          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In this demonstration, Stacey Butter—a developer encountering a compromised app deployment due to crypto mining malware within her Kubernetes cluster—seeks assistance from S. Potter and A.G. Veytia. They identify that the malicious payload is introduced via a compromised compiler image utilized in their build process, despite robust network policies, secrets management, and unprivileged pods.

The speakers propose an enhanced security approach centered around the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) Baseline: a framework with incremental security practices. This includes implementing salsa test stations for builder image integrity, securing source registries using Salsa tools, verifying pod provenance, and applying signature verification policies like Six Store.

The Baseline encompasses eight control families, spanning various risk categories beyond just cybersecurity. It offers three levels (foundation, community, enterprise) to adapt to project maturity and user base size, ensuring sustainable, well-documented, and governance-driven projects.

Key takeaways emphasize that security isn&#x27;t an all-at-once endeavor; it&#x27;s about taking methodical steps to minimize risks. By following these controls, developers can naturally incorporate security compliance into their workflows, gradually hardening their software development life cycles and protecting against supply chain attacks.

Speakers encourage participation in community initiatives such as Merge Forward for fostering diverse collaboration and learning, as well as acknowledging the contributions of others and recognizing the inspiration derived from previous talks on security best practices. They also invite viewers to engage with OpenSSF at their booth or through various channels, reinforcing that everyone can contribute to making open-source software more secure.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The key focus of this sponsored keynote is bridging the gap between cloud-native and agent-native infrastructure for agentic AI applications in production. The primary challenges identified are in security, observability, and governance for AI agents, which often lack operational expertise despite teams&#x27; proficiency in writing agents.

The speakers emphasize the importance of Kubernetes as a platform for hosting these AI agents, highlighting the necessity to extend Kubernetes capabilities to support context-aware operations, including access to the request body (for data) in addition to headers. They discuss the limitations of traditional networking approaches and introduce solutions like Agent Gateway, an open-source project donated to the Cloud Native Foundation (CNCF). This tool enhances Kubernetes by adding context awareness for AI workloads, enabling support for stateful human-in-the-loop processes and securing, observing, and monitoring agents regardless of their underlying frameworks or environments.

Another critical component missing from an agentic AI production stack is a context-aware registry to manage AI artifacts—agents, tools, and models. To address this, the speakers announce Agent Registry, an open-source project designed for full lifecycle management of these AI elements. It can integrate multiple private and public registries, implement curation policies using scoring and evaluation criteria, enforce access control, and support private registrations, thereby streamlining the development and platform management processes for agentic AI applications.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Niantic, developers of Pokémon Go and other location-based augmented reality games, are showcasing their approach to scaling machine learning for global gameplay through a combination of Kubernetes, Qflow, and various open-source CNCF projects. The key challenge revolves around optimizing raid battles in Pokémon Go, ensuring players encounter suitable raids at appropriate times and locations, while considering diverse player skill levels, localities, and real-time game constraints.

To address this complex geotemporal scheduling problem, Niantic transitioned from rule-based systems to a data-driven approach utilizing machine learning models trained on vast amounts of player data. The model predicts expected raid participation across millions of potential triplets (raid types, gym locations, and times) daily, generating a massive set of predictions.

However, raw prediction scores alone were insufficient; they required refinement through a sophisticated scheduling system that balanced maximizing participation with maintaining diversity and player engagement. This hybrid approach combines linear programming for optimizing maximum participation and weighted random sampling to introduce surprise and variety into the game world.

Niantic’s infrastructure leverages open-source CNCF projects like Kubernetes, Qflow (their machine learning platform), Kserve, Argo workflows, and more, enabling seamless scaling of their ML systems across various data models and production environments. The team emphasizes the importance of agile development practices and robust operational processes, ensuring reliability and confidence in their predictions while adapting to ever-changing player patterns due to seasonal game dynamics.

Collaboration with teams like Team Valor (Confident reproducibility), Team Mystic (Rigorous experimentation), and Team Instinct (Visibility and intuitive monitoring) highlights the company&#x27;s commitment to data-driven decision-making and continuous improvement of player experience. Through this combination of geotemporal modeling, open-source tooling, and solid ML operations practices, Niantic achieved significant growth in raid engagement and sustained enhancements to player satisfaction.

The talk underscores the importance of open-source principles in building scalable systems, adhering to ethical considerations like fairness, privacy, and safety, as well as embracing adaptability and collaboration for enduring success in global gaming environments.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation delves into anchoring trust in the era of AI, focusing on identities across humans, machines, and models within a cloud-native ecosystem. The speaker emphasizes that every technological revolution has been characterized by a need for trust, from internet firewalls to cloud security measures like OAUTH and OpenID Connect. These specifications have been implemented through projects like Keycloak, enabling web apps, APIs, and microservices to verify identities.

As AI emerges as a significant force, the speaker stresses that AI workloads also require strong identity assurance. An AI agent, when interacting with external APIs or various services, needs secure identification – a challenge not yet fully addressed by existing identity systems focused on human users. This is where Queser comes in, a standardized Kubernetes-native platform for deploying and managing both generative and predictive AI models. Queser, recently incubated under the Cloud Native Foundation (CNCF), ensures model inference adheres to the same robust identity and authentication framework used for other workloads, leveraging technologies like OIDC Keycloak and OATH.

By weaving together Kerf, Keycloak, OpenID Connect, and Spiffy Inspire, the CNCF ecosystem offers a comprehensive foundation for anchoring trust across humans, machines, and models in AI&#x27;s agentic age. The key takeaway is that Kubernetes, traditionally used to simplify complex systems, now also secures the untrustworthy by providing a secure foundation for scalable AI workloads – an essential component for building trust in AI technologies.

The speaker encourages audience participation and collaboration within the cloud-native security projects community, urging listeners to contribute to initiatives like Queser and explore trusted agents with MCP servers and Spiffy Inspire. This holistic approach ensures that as we move into the age of agentic AI, trust can be seamlessly integrated across all components, paving the way for secure, accountable, and innovative AI platforms.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Apple has introduced containerization on macOS, aiming for enhanced security and privacy without compromising performance. This is achieved by running Linux containers within lightweight virtual machines (microVMs), utilizing Apple&#x27;s virtualization framework. Each container operates in its own isolated environment, with resources allocated only when needed, ensuring subsecond startup times.

Security is bolstered by direct booting the Linux kernel with minimal configurations, reducing the attack surface and enhancing performance. The file system within these microVMs lacks common utilities and dynamic libraries typically found in full virtual machines, further minimizing potential vulnerabilities. Processes are compiled as static executables to avoid linking to unneeded libraries.

Developers are encouraged to leverage this technology by using the APIs provided in containerization for building custom solutions or enhancing existing ones via plugins. The macOS community is invited to try out containerization and engage with the development team at a dedicated session later today. Those interested in the intersection of containers and virtualization are warmly welcomed to join Apple&#x27;s team.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">OpenAI, leveraging open-source technology, employs Fluent Bit for processing logs at scale to support their advanced AI models like GPT5. The team faces immense telemetry data, necessitating efficient logging solutions. Fluent Bit&#x27;s CPU usage was a significant concern due to its deployment on every Kubernetes node. Initially assuming Fluent Bit spent most time in expensive string processing within Lua, they used Perf for investigations. Surprisingly, they discovered fstat 64 consumed the most CPU time—35% of each Fluent Bit process&#x27;s time. This function, utilized by both tail and i-notify plugins, was called frequently to determine log file sizes, which wasn&#x27;t efficient given the infrequent writes in their environment. Disabling i-notify reduced CPU usage by half while maintaining the same work output, freeing up 30,000 CPU cores. This optimization resulted in a 50% reduction in CPU load across heavily loaded Fluent Bit pods. The team is now working on upstream improvements to enable specifying minimum intervals for better performance without disabling i-notify.

The talk emphasizes the benefits of open-source software in enabling organizations to concentrate on core business problems, leveraging pre-built scalability solutions. It underscores the importance of periodic profiling for identifying such performance bottlenecks and highlights the ease of using modern profiling tools without deep programming knowledge. The overall message encourages users to profile their open-source software under load to uncover potential improvements, thereby contributing to better collective performance in the tech community.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Frank Mancina, from Haroxy Technologies, discusses the limitations of current service meshes in simplifying modern connectivity within today&#x27;s complex enterprise environments. He highlights that service meshes, while intended to address connectivity issues, often relocate complexity elsewhere due to the fractured nature of enterprises—comprising multiple clouds, clusters, on-premises data centers, and legacy applications.

Mancina identifies two main service mesh architectures: sidecar and sidecarless. Sidecar architectures, though effective at a smaller scale, become overly complex and costly as they&#x27;re scaled to large numbers of pods. Sidecarless architectures distribute complexity across various distributed components (layer four proxies per node, layer seven proxies per namespace or service account), but still fail in unifying hybrid clouds, managing north-south traffic, and supporting federated setups.

The core issue, according to Mancina, lies not at the service level but rather at the network boundaries. Haroxy&#x27;s Universal Mesh aims to tackle this by eliminating sprawling sidecar and proxy deployments. This approach consolidates ingress, mesh, and proxy into a unified, federated system powered by Haroxy’s robust reverse proxy experience—spanning 20+ years of proven performance and reliability.

Mancina outlines Universal Mesh&#x27;s three pillars: the control plane (Haroxy Fusion) communicating with APIs across multiple clusters; the data plane relying on Haroxy for north-south and east-west communication, enabling omni-directional support across Kubernetes clusters, clouds, container services, and on-premises infrastructure.

The Universal Mesh leverages intelligent routing and policies without forcing architectural compromises, thanks to its understanding of both Kubernetes resources and infrastructure resources. It supports flexible deployment models, allowing gateways external or internal to Kubernetes for traditional vs. cloud-native workloads. This results in simpler connectivity, reduced overhead, and no extra latency on every pod, node, or cluster.

In essence, Haroxy&#x27;s Universal Mesh promises a paradigm shift in enterprise connectivity by addressing the root causes of complexity within service meshes – rather than just tactical problems within constrained boundaries – ultimately enabling organizations to overcome limitations imposed by current connectivity and focus on driving innovation.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In this keynote, Greg Kroah-Hartman, a prominent Linux kernel developer, addresses the EU&#x27;s Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), explaining its implications for open-source developers and maintainers. The CRA is essentially a software inventory law, requiring listing all software components in devices or products to ensure they&#x27;re safe, up-to-date, and vulnerability-free. This applies to manufacturers and integrators but not to individual hobbyists or non-commercial entities using open-source software in closed systems.

Kroah-Hartman reassures developers that the CRA isn&#x27;t a cause for fear, emphasizing that most open-source projects already comply with this law&#x27;s requirements since they&#x27;re involved in the creation of secure and updated software. For maintainers or stewards managing larger open-source projects, there are two primary responsibilities:

1. Maintain an up-to-date contact point for reporting security issues.
2. Proactively engage with the security fix process, even without directly fixing it themselves.

The CRA is expected to have practical tools and resources supporting compliance, such as the reuse tool by FSFE (Fraunhofer Society for Open Source) that generates Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), and checklists provided by OSS Foundation (OSSF). Manufacturers will start implementing the law in June 2023, with CRA-related assessments becoming formal. By September 2027, the entire regulation applies to all software users, giving open-source contributors ample time to adapt.

As standards development progresses for cybersecurity best practices, they&#x27;ll remain voluntary at first. Kroah-Hartman encourages participation in these ongoing efforts and highlights resources like the CRA site, training courses, documentation, FAQs, and future materials from the EU. In essence, while the CRA introduces new requirements, open-source developers can rest assured that their current practices already align with many aspects of this law, making compliance manageable without major changes for most individuals in the community.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In this keynote, JGO Macleod of Google shares an update on Kubernetes&#x27; evolution and future trajectory:

1. Reliability: Kubernetes now boasts robust rollback functionality, a feature that has taken over a decade to develop. This capability ensures nearly five-nines reliability in upgrades and allows for smooth yearly updates without the need for frequent, risky downgrades. It&#x27;s currently enabled on Google&#x27;s GKE platform.

2. Hardware: Google has integrated Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRA) as a General Availability (GA) feature. This enhances AI workload portability and functionality by enabling Kubernetes to better understand underlying hardware infrastructure nuances. The scheduler and autoscaler are being revamped for increased awareness of the hardware, simplifying the user experience without requiring deep hardware expertise.

3. Framework Orchestration: Google has been collaborating with Slurm and Ray communities to improve their compatibility on Kubernetes. Innovations like in-place pod resizing enhance Ray&#x27;s performance while optimizing Slurm scheduling for higher efficiency.

4. Upcoming Trends: The talk emphasizes the shift from mere automation within Kubernetes to autonomy – a natural progression of the platform&#x27;s declarative API and decoupled controllers becoming more intelligent. This transition promises safer and smarter operations on Kubernetes clusters.

5. Introducing Agent Sandbox (SIG apps): To ensure safety and security, Google introduces a new resource type called agent sandbox under SIG apps. This feature enhances the agent infrastructure&#x27;s capabilities for safe implementation of changes across Kubernetes environments, thereby potentially boosting platform adoption.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Abby Bangser, in her keynote at CubeCon Cloud Native Con, emphasized the evolving role of platform engineering to accommodate AI adoption. She outlined a new playbook for preparing platforms for AI integration, focusing on why platforms are built (to reduce scope and complexity for application teams) and ensuring they don&#x27;t strip autonomy but rather provide focus and control over essential dependencies.

Bangser identified three common platform patterns: ticket cue, the Oprah, and template pattern. She highlighted that while these solutions address specific concerns, they often introduce new problems and challenges due to their reactive nature. The ticket cue system slows down processes, while the &quot;Infrastructure for Everyone&quot; approach can lead to unsupervised, inconsistent infrastructure management across an organization. The template pattern, aiming to combine self-service with business relevance and safety controls, ultimately results in a complex ecosystem where platform engineers become full-time puppy parents, unable to provide high-level guidance or leverage their skills efficiently.

To build effective platforms, Bangser advocated for adopting principles centered around self-service APIs, relevance to the business, and managed service approach. Organizations should strive to create a centralized platform that caters to both consumers (application teams) and producers (internal specialists), offering an enterprise app store where various tools and resources can be easily accessed, upgraded, and maintained by specialized teams.

The key is recognizing that internal platforms serve as a specialized internal economy of scale tailored to an organization&#x27;s unique needs, distinct from off-the-shelf products. Buying what’s available in the market and building something bespoke to support multiple teams creates this economy of scale, allowing for continuous evolution and adaptation.

Bangser also stressed the importance of tactics for implementing these strategies. Centralized teams struggle to keep up with constant requests, leading to pain points. Organizing around a multi-persona marketplace, where both consumers (application teams) and producers (internal specialists) can self-serve and contribute, is essential for scaling platform engineering efforts.

Introducing APIs that encode the principles of self-service, business relevance, and fleet management would allow specialized teams to seamlessly integrate their expertise into the organization’s infrastructure, freeing up platform engineers&#x27; time for supporting these APIs and developing tools tailored to diverse specialists within the company.

In conclusion, Bangser encouraged audiences to view the CNCF as a resource beyond CubeCon, emphasizing its role in fostering collaboration, learning, and governance across cloud-native technologies. She urged experimentation, measurement, and continuous improvement of platform engineering practices within organizations to nurture a culture of innovation that transcends single teams and permeates the entire enterprise.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">At Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, AI builders require high performance compute, storage, and networking for delivering next-generation AI models and agents that power enterprises. The platform must ensure data security with access control and auditability while offering stability for long-running mission-critical jobs. GPUs and budgets are finite, necessitating platforms providing high performance and return on investment.

The key to this ecosystem lies in open-source and the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). Oracle leverages Kubernetes as its foundation, utilizing CNCF projects such as Q and jobset for managing diverse workloads from large pre-training jobs to numerous inference tasks across multiple providers. The architecture benefits from bare metal servers alongside virtual machines, offering close-to-data center functionality without the infrastructure overhead.

Cohere focuses on delivering secure AI from foundation models up to applications, employing Kubernetes as their core infrastructure component. After training, models need packaging into applications for clients&#x27; use, catering to self-hosting and airgapped environments. Cohere utilizes Helm charts for package management, enabling deployment across seven clouds with different managed Kubernetes offerings.

The North Agent platform runs on a single node with an embedded Kubernetes cluster, while production setups integrate seamlessly into cloud providers like Oracle Cloud. This architecture allows clients to benefit from managed components when applicable and focus on delivering models and applications that drive AI-driven agentic flows. Through this approach, Cohere delivers cloud-native, secure AI solutions for the enterprise built upon contributions to CNCF projects.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Kubernetes networking is evolving to accommodate diverse workloads, including AI/ML training and high-performance computing (HPC) that demand specific hardware access and low latency. The existing Kubernetes networking model struggled with these new requirements due to non-portability across different Kubernetes distributions. This led to the creation of custom solutions by various communities, resulting in fragmentation and deviating from the core Kubernetes principle of consistent, portable APIs.

In response, a collaborative effort among multiple companies and communities began around ten years ago, eventually leading to standardization. The community-driven evolution resulted in the development of Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA), a new approach that offers a unified language for describing and managing resources, regardless of their type. DRA is declarative, extensible, and addresses hardware access needs without causing fragmentation, making it possible to have a consistent API across Kubernetes distributions.

The Kubernetes network driver—K&amp;D—has been built on top of DRA, allowing pods to request specific resources via resource claims. This setup ensures better hardware utilization, predictable behavior, and enhanced performance by expressing exactly what is needed in a declarative manner. A demo showcased the use of DRA for configuring interfaces with desired MTU sizes, demonstrating its power and user-friendliness.

Lionel Jouin from Red Hat announced the donation of Kubernetes Network Driver (DNET) to the Cloud Native Foundation (CNCF), making it a true project under the Kubernetes umbrella. DNET is designed to coordinate with various hardware drivers, optimizing performance for different components like accelerators, CPUs, and storage systems in an interconnected ecosystem. The community-driven nature of this development ensures ongoing collaboration, feedback, and progress towards creating a more unified and efficient Kubernetes networking environment for the future.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In this sponsored keynote, Jorge Palma highlights two open-source projects, KAOITO and CubeFleet, designed to simplify and scale multicluster AI deployment. These tools address the challenges of proprietary solutions by offering common frameworks, faster iteration, and quicker transition from development to production.

KAOITO is a Kubernetes AI toolchain operator, facilitating easy deployment and management of AI inferencing models in Kubernetes clusters. It utilizes workspace constructs, enabling users to pass their models and defer GPU provisioning tasks to its GPU provisioner. KAOITO also supports fine-tuning, grounding, and parameter tuning for model optimization.

CubeFleet intelligently distributes workloads across Kubernetes clusters worldwide, identifying available GPU capacity and deploying models accordingly. By leveraging CubeFleet, users can efficiently route requests to the optimal inferencing pools based on performance metrics. In conjunction with an inferencing gateway, this setup allows for global model serving and efficient routing.

Palma demonstrates a three-cluster architecture, illustrating how KAOITO is used to deploy DeepSeek and 54 models in separate inferencing clusters, managed by CubeFleet. The inferencing pools are placed within the same clusters as their corresponding models, using labels managed by KAOITO. A gateway API constructs, including an HTTP route, is deployed in a dedicated gateway cluster for content-aware routing to appropriate models.

The presented architecture efficiently utilizes available GPU resources across multiple regions, with the potential to adapt to any Kubernetes provider by its users. Both projects—KAOITO and CubeFleet—are currently accessible, allowing developers to explore, test, and build upon them in their environments.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The keynote, delivered by Jeremy Rickard and Alex Chircop at CubeCon, marked the 10th anniversary of Kubernetes and the Cloud Native Foundation (CNCF). Over the past decade, the CNCF has seen remarkable growth with over 200 projects, hundreds of thousands of contributors, and a thriving ecosystem. This expansion includes container runtimes, security services like service mesh options, observability tools such as Prometheus and OpenTelemetry, packaging solutions like Helm, and various operating systems for complex workloads.

The CNCF&#x27;s charter aims to make cloud-native computing ubiquitous, which they&#x27;ve achieved significantly. However, the speakers highlight that progress doesn&#x27;t halt here. They emphasize three primary opportunities shaping the future of the community: AI integration, enhancing security, and addressing ongoing projects&#x27; sustainability.

AI is currently a hot topic, with projects focusing on model packaging, building agents, and DevOps workflows compatible with Kubernetes. Existing projects are also evolving to accommodate this demand, such as dynamic resource allocation in Kubernetes 134 and the launch of the Kubernetes AI conformance program. Additionally, DRET (Distributed Resource and Execution Tracker) is a new project entering the ecosystem, while Kerf has joined as a mature project enhancing container runtimes.

Security remains another pressing concern for the community, with projects like ingress engine X approaching archival due to maintainer availability and vulnerabilities. The CNCF acknowledges this challenge and looks towards collaborative efforts to tackle security concerns across multiple projects while maintaining innovation.

External factors like the Cybersecurity Resilience Act also pose challenges, requiring the community to find ways to share security information more holistically. Ultimately, the vision is to create self-service platforms integrating AI, observability, and security for rapid iteration and adaptation in this dynamic space.

To address these opportunities, the CNCF has restructured itself with five new technical oversight committees (TOCs), focusing on Developer Experience, Infrastructure, Operational Resilience &amp; Security, Workload Foundations, and other specialized areas. These initiatives will drive crisp deliverables like white papers, best practices, policy updates, and more through time-bound projects or sub-projects.

To involve the community, the CNCF has developed a new website, contribute.cncf.io, providing resources and guidance for project maintainers. It includes information on the project life cycle, community involvement, and collaboration with TOCs, tags, and technical community groups. Projects can be found in the pavilion section of the CNCF website.

In summary, Jeremy Rickard and Alex Chircop highlighted the CNCF&#x27;s 10-year milestone while looking ahead to AI integration, enhanced security measures, and ensuring project sustainability. They introduced new TOCs and initiatives to tackle these challenges, fostering community involvement through resources like contribute.cncf.io and emphasizing the ongoing commitment to making cloud-native computing accessible and robust for the future.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">At Amazon, understanding and managing peak traffic, such as during Black Friday, is crucial for maintaining service availability and customer satisfaction. The user journey involves multiple services being activated sequentially – search, product detail pages, shopping cart, payment, and shipping – creating a complex cascade effect. Traditional reactive scaling falls short during these peaks due to latency in detecting high load and initiating scaling actions.

To address this, Amazon employs proactive capacity planning using metrics like Mean Time To Traffic (MTT) or breaking point Transaction Per Second (TPS). MTT measures the time it takes for a service to scale up from idle to a loaded state under demand, while TPS represents the maximum load a single service can handle before Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are violated.

Amazon utilizes forecasting for peak events, like Prime Day and Black Friday, to anticipate traffic patterns and plan capacity requirements over multiple horizons. They produce probabilistic forecasts using one percentile thresholds (e.g., P90) instead of single-point estimates, enabling risk quantification and better decision-making. Stress tests are conducted for readiness assurance and to verify service capacity against their breaking points.

The complexity of interconnected services necessitates consistent scaling across the entire ecosystem rather than individual components. Traffic call fan ratios are monitored to ensure all services scale uniformly, accounting for varying costs associated with different requests. Amazon&#x27;s forecasting models incorporate external factors like cultural events, as seen in the 2022 FIFA World Cup coinciding with Black Friday in Brazil and Serbia, by analyzing potential behavioral impacts on traffic patterns.

Throughout peak events, Amazon continuously updates its forecast based on real-time data, adjusts scaling guidance, and maintains lead time for response to ensure optimal resource allocation and minimal customer impact.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">This discussion explores transitioning from monolithic architectures to microservices, addressing questions about when and how to decouple components. Key takeaways include:

1. Microservice adoption isn&#x27;t always immediate or uniform across the entire codebase; it depends on use cases and organizational complexity.
2. While possible, maintaining a monolithic application with separate repositories for different components can introduce significant operational overhead.
3. Aligning with business teams is crucial to determine the best approach, as misaligned separation might lead to complexities in deployment, management, and communication between services.
4. Microservices offer scalability and resilience but come with added complexity in terms of networking, data consistency, and fault tolerance that must be carefully managed.
5. Deciding whether a request should be synchronous or asynchronous within microservices hinges on business requirements; synchronous might be appropriate for real-time actions like payments, while asynchronous could be more suitable for non-critical tasks such as sending order confirmations via email.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">At Spotify, a senior product manager (Shri) and a senior engineer (Kate) developed the Scorecard plugin to address challenges posed by over 30,000 software components, manual tracking methods, and growing tool fragmentation. Prior to the plug-in&#x27;s creation, teams relied on spreadsheets for managing these components, which became increasingly cumbersome due to their sheer volume.

The Scorecard plugin serves as a unified interface for monitoring various aspects of tech health, such as testing, security, compliance, and adherence to best practices, drawing data from multiple third-party systems. It offers a user-friendly no-code UI, allowing teams to configure checks and view results directly in Backstage, an internal collaboration platform at Spotify.

The introduction of the Scorecard plugin yielded significant improvements:
- Productivity boosts, including seven more deployments per active production component for squads using the tool.
- Efficiency gains, with 20% decrease in master branch build failures and 25% reduction in high urgency incidents.
- The plug-in&#x27;s external adoption began in December 2022, reaching over 50 organizations.

However, maintaining the internal and external versions of the plugin presented challenges:
- Technical debt due to commercial ambitions colliding with engineering constraints.
- Ensuring unification between the two versions while preserving historical data and integrating new features.
- Addressing diverse user needs among internal and external teams.

Key takeaways from their journey for building successful platform plug-ins include:
1. Treat your platform as a product, align it with broader company goals, and communicate this vision effectively.
2. Understand both internal and external users through continuous feedback loops and user interviews.
3. Use structured prioritization methods like the ICE model to ensure alignment between product and technical strategies.
4. Leverage early wins from pilot projects to build momentum and expand the platform&#x27;s utility.
5. Design for scalability, adaptability, and future growth by anticipating increased demands in terms of users, data, or new features.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The talk emphasizes self-hosting on Kubernetes for data privacy, cost control, and customization in deploying large transformer models. The process is broken down into four steps: model selection, fitting, serving, and communications. For fitting huge models, a hybrid approach of tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism is employed. Prefetch decoding disaggregation (PD) is highlighted as an efficient method to separate the initial token generation processing from the decoding stage, reducing interference between them.

Benchmarks demonstrate significant latency reduction under load with PD compared to non-disaggregated methods. For large multi-node systems, fall tolerance becomes critical, requiring Kubernetes&#x27; intelligent recovery mechanisms for worker group failures. The future may see attention and FFN disaggressions optimized for network performance, though currently, PD is more prevalent in production due to its stability.

The speaker suggests that determining the optimal ratio of prefill and decode pods depends on workload-specific factors like input/output lengths, TTFT, TPOT, and GPU memory capacities, and should be benchmarked against specific use cases. Observability tools are utilized for monitoring performance, adhering to SLIs (Service Level Indicators) such as TTFT and TPOT.

Regarding topology aware scheduling within a node, the speaker mentions that aligning nick and GPU can optimize resource usage but is more challenging between nodes, where cloud providers typically do not expose this level of detail. The community is working on solutions through APIs like Topology Spread Constraints in Kubernetes or Disaggregated Resource Allocation with Dataflow (DRA).

In summary, the talk underscores the importance of self-hosting transformer models on Kubernetes for optimal control over data privacy and costs while employing advanced techniques such as tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and prefetch decoding disaggregation for enhanced performance. It also stresses the need for intelligent fall tolerance mechanisms in multi-node deployments and the ongoing development of topology aware scheduling solutions within Kubernetes and cloud environments.</div>

Key features include automatic configuration of experiment setups in controlled environments like GKE clusters, self-hosted Prometheus or Google manage Prometheus integration for metric scraping, and support for request life cycle metrics alongside custom Prometheus metrics. The tool aims to isolate test results by ensuring no spillover during simultaneous experiments. While it currently requires a managed Prometheus endpoint within the cloud service (e.g., GKE, AWS EKS) or manual configuration of a Prometheus server if not available, plans for supporting other manage Prometheus platforms are in progress. InferencePerf is designed to provide unbiased benchmarking results by treating different serving stacks and model server configurations as black boxes with respect to comparison. The project&#x27;s primary goal is to become the go-to resource for inference benchmarking, continuously expanding its capabilities through community contributions.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">This presentation emphasizes the importance of prioritizing immediate fixes during outages and understanding platform intricacies, particularly when dealing with APF (Access Control Protocol Filter) tooling like Retina for Kubernetes. The team highlights several key takeaways:

1. Rapid response is crucial during outages: When users are impacted, immediately address the issue by disabling unnecessary tools or configurations. In this case, they used mutation webhooks to disable Retina&#x27;s diagnostic features temporarily.

2. Leverage Kubernetes ecosystem flexibility: The team stresses the power of customizable tooling within Kubernetes, encouraging users to be familiar with available options and choose the best fit for their workload.

3. Don&#x27;t just mitigate; investigate: While resolving an issue, stop and analyze potential causes rather than immediately jumping into fixing. This approach helps uncover systematic problems that could otherwise lead to recurring outages.

4. BPF tooling varies: The team notes that not all BPF toolings have moved away from per-CPU rings buffers, emphasizing the need for users to be aware of potential performance implications when selecting and using such tools.

5. Ring buffers can offer benefits: The presentation highlights how switching to ring buffer implementations (e.g., in Celium) led to better performance compared to per-CPU rings.

6. Be mindful of observability tax: While utilizing APF tooling, be aware that there might be additional overhead or performance degradation associated with the chosen tools and configurations.

7. Collaborate for improvement: Encourage engagement with open-source projects to report issues and advocate for enhancements, like in this instance of Celium moving away from per-CPU rings buffers.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The talk discusses various methods for network security in containerized environments, focusing on authentication and authorization techniques:

1. IP-based methods (e.g., network policy): These offer limited confidentiality and integrity but can be easily compromised since IPs are not reliable identifiers of identity. They require minimal operational cost but have a high security vulnerability.

2. TLS/SSL with IP-based authentication: This approach provides some level of encryption and integrity but still relies on insecure IP-based authentication, sharing similar limitations as the first method.

3. Service meshes (e.g., Linker): These offer robust security features, including MTLS for mutual authentication and authorization, and are deployed as sidecars around pods. They provide better isolation, minimizing a compromised pod&#x27;s blast radius compared to ambient approaches. The operational cost is moderate but provides stronger security.

4. Self-building security (e.g., application-level MTLS): This method requires extensive expertise and maintenance, as the user must manage private keys, rotation, certificate chains, ciphers, and other aspects, leading to a higher operational cost.

The talk emphasizes that the optimal security setup depends on an organization&#x27;s priorities, resources, and operational capabilities, balancing factors such as cost, performance, and blast radius. The presenter advocates for service meshes like Linker for their efficient trade-off between security and operational complexity, particularly for MPC workloads.</div>

1. The team is open to receiving PRs for customize documentation but emphasizes that it&#x27;s currently owned by Kubernetes, and an ongoing effort is underway to migrate all relevant documents into the main Kubernetes documentation infrastructure. Customize 6 will likely reside under a new kubernetes subdomain.

2. CubeCuddle, a sub-project of ckubectl, will continue to be supported due to users&#x27; reliance on it. However, future developments might focus on making standalone customize more feature-rich than its integrated counterpart within ckubectl, which will only support core functionality.

3. The release cycle for CubeCuddle differs from the standalone customize; while the standalone customize is released frequently (potentially monthly), cube cuddle adheres to Kubernetes&#x27; three-year release schedule. Users relying on newer features are encouraged to use the standalone customize tool instead of the integrated one.

The team acknowledges potential decisions made differently if they had the opportunity, particularly regarding the release cycle and integration strategy.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Payal Godhani, from Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, discusses a framework to safeguard Kubernetes resources against dangerous deletes before Helm deployments in production. Facing rapid expansion and deploying 100+ releases daily, Oracle encountered incidents like accidentally deleting 18 load balancers for a multi-million dollar customer due to minor Helm chart changes. This led to substantial downtime, errors, data loss, and customer trust erosion.

Godhani explains that Helm, while declarative, doesn&#x27;t inherently warn about potential resource deletions during its execution, causing issues since it assumes a clean slate for new deployments based on previous and proposed charts. This led to the development of Helmiff—an open-source plug-in integrated into Oracle&#x27;s deployment service pipeline.

Helmiff operates during planning time by examining the current cluster state, proposed changes, and generating visualizations of potential impacts, highlighting unintended consequences like load balancer or persistent volume deletions. By identifying critical resources such as load balancers, persistent volumes, permissions, CRDs, and network policies, Godhani’s team classified them into three categories based on potential risk: high, medium, low.

The guardrails framework uses Helmiff&#x27;s output to conduct risk assessments, determining if a release requires blocking (warning the deployment service), second-level approval from management, or proceeding with confidence. This empowers deployment services to execute releases with greater assurance and reduces incidents of production downtime, resource deletions, and errors.

Demo showcases how Helmiff and guardrails framework analyze and summarize potential changes during a proposed Helm upgrade, identifying critical resource alterations such as secret modifications, disabled load balancers, and PVC deletions. This approach has significantly decreased incidents of seven and sub-two levels in Oracle&#x27;s operations, enhancing deployment awareness and confidence.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Dragonfly v2.3.0 introduces significant enhancements in image distribution, file management, and AI infrastructure support within cloud native environments. Key updates include:

1. **Image Acceleration**: Drumfly offers three solutions for image acceleration. The first utilizes P2P for distributing container images across large clusters, enhancing download speeds. Secondly, it employs a more efficient method using DroneFly and Nidus for accelerated image distribution, minimizing container launch times. Lastly, it leverages Nidus to distribute compressed, on-demand model files, further reducing container startup duration from minutes to seconds.

2. **File Distribution**: Drumfly addresses large-scale file distribution by using a P2P mechanism that effectively eliminates the constraints of original bandwidth limitations. It supports HTTP and ADFS protocols and various object storage systems like S3, OSS, OBS. This solution is designed to boost read/write performance while sharing files within clusters.

3. **AI Infrastructure**: Drumfly distributes data during AI training and inference processes. For AI inference, it can distribute models using Triton server and PyTorch serve, along with on-demand model downloading from the Hugging Face hub via the Hugging Face SDK through a Drumfly ATP proxy.

The new DroneFly 2.3 release includes:

1. **Persistent Cache Task**: This feature allows importing and exporting files within P2P clusters, enhancing read/write performance by using the TLV (Type-Value-Label) format as a lightweight transfer protocol.

2. **Vertex Transfer Protocol Replacement**: Drumfly replaces gRPC with a lighter protocol based on TLV and value formats, potentially reducing download times by up to 40%.

3. **Load Quality Scoring**: This feature evaluates parent bandwidth usage, duration, radio, and efficiency, strategically distributing files across multiple peers, thus optimizing download performance.

4. **Preheating Enhancements**: Users can now preheat tasks flexibly based on IP percentage and count to further reduce download times. Rate limiting is also added for preheating tasks to prevent overloading the origin storage bandwidth.

5. **Audit Logging &amp; Garbage Collection**: Drumfly introduces comprehensive audit logging to track user operations in the system, along with automated garbage collection of outdated records.

6. **Optimized OCI Artifact Support**: DroneFly now supports Kubernetes&#x27; video-only volume feature based on OCI artifacts, allowing users to package AI model weights and configurations into a single container image for efficient data distribution within clusters. The Model Pack project enables this functionality, utilizing CNCF&#x27;s Build, push, and pull tools for packaging models, and creating a model CSI driver for Kubernetes compatibility.

The speaker envisions an upcoming shift in infrastructure from machine-centric to AI model-centric, where foundational projects like Drumfly will play a pivotal role in building immutable infrastructure centered around AI models.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The Java Operator SDK&#x27;s recent updates aim to address resource version comparison issues in Kubernetes, specifically with custom resources. The core problem lies in eventual consistency when utilizing informers for cache management during reconciliations. To solve this, the SDK employs a temporary caching mechanism, updating this cache after resource modifications and ensuring the next reconciliation retrieves the most recent version from both the informer cache and the temporal cache.

A significant upcoming Kubernetes enhancement is the introduction of comparable resource versions, which will eliminate the need for optimistic locking mechanisms currently used to ensure consistent updates in custom resources. This change will simplify framework operations and enhance efficiency by filtering out self-update events, thus sparing reconciliation cycles. The new version also promises enhanced optimizations for resource management, making the overall process seamless and more efficient.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In this presentation, several key points about Kubernetes features and infrastructure were discussed:

1. Kubernetes Pod resource allocation is &quot;all or nothing&quot; per pod, meaning changes to CPU, memory, requests, and limits for multiple containers within a single pod must either all apply or none do at once.
2. Currently, Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) applies recommendations uniformly across replicas in a controller (deployment, replica set, etc.), but plans are in place to extend this functionality so that individual pods can have different resource sizes based on their demands, particularly for daemonsets with variable node demands.
3. The in-progress VPA enhancement will allow different resources for multiple pods, not just within a single pod.
4. The speaker clarified that a stuck pod&#x27;s constraints won&#x27;t block resizing of other pods, as allocation is per pod level and not shared across all pods or controllers.
5. Ray Autoscaler v2, developed by Ray, manages pods directly rather than relying on Kubernetes deployments. It modifies pods in place for scaling purposes. The speaker suggested that if there&#x27;s a strong use case, multi-dimensional autoscaling could be integrated into Kubernetes, possibly through a donation to the open source community.
6. While Multi-dimensional Autoscaler exists in GK (Google Kubernetes Engine), it uses Ray&#x27;s runtime directly for pod management, unlike Kubernetes HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) and VPA, which operate on Kubernetes-level abstractions. The speaker emphasized that now that VPA can perform in-place scaling, discussions regarding potential integration with multi-dimensional autoscaling tools like GK&#x27;s Multi-Dimensional Autoscaler could occur.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Kubernetes&#x27; access control system, currently based on role-based and attribute-based access control (RBAC and ABAC), is being enhanced with Cedar, a new open-source authorization language in CNCF. Cedar introduces a unified interface using its expressive authorization language for both read and write policies, allowing fine-grained control over resources like secrets based on type or label selectors. The project also emphasizes analyzability, ensuring that policies can be mathematically proven to be consistent and free from logical inconsistencies. Future developments might include reference grant for inter-namespace object references and advanced authorization features such as RBAC++ (role-based access control). Audience is encouraged to join the SIG for authentication and authorization in Kubernetes, engage with project maintainers, and stay updated on implementations and proposals.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Teams should manage feature flags with intentionality, considering their purpose (release management, experimentation, operational toggles, permissions/entitlements), and plan for their lifespan. Unmanaged or unnecessary feature flags can lead to hidden complexity, increased tech debt, and difficulties in removal. To mitigate these issues, invest time in feature flag management strategies, establish patterns, and consider using tools like OpenFeature CLI for easier management and type safety. Additionally, ensure proper testing infrastructure for flags, considering their interactions within the system and potential for overriding during testing periods. Lastly, while a comprehensive taxonomy of feature flags might be beneficial, existing categorizations (release management, experimentation, operational toggles, permissions/entitlements) provide a solid starting point for decision-making regarding flag implementation and duration.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">This presentation details optimization strategies for deploying machine learning models using Amazon EKS, Carpenter, and SoI with parallel processing enabled through SoI&#x27;s Sage service. Key optimizations include:

1. Enabling AWS EBS parallelism (CSI driver) for reducing model loading time from 500 seconds to 152 seconds, followed by further reductions to 78 seconds using pre-pooling techniques.
2. Utilizing FSX for Lustre for improved model storage and access, with the setup taking 110 seconds compared to EBS alternatives. This method achieves a total cycle time of 3 minutes and 11 seconds, significantly reducing inference latency from 40 minutes and 30 seconds without optimizations.
3. Employing RunAI for direct model loading from S3, resulting in minimal additional wait times.
4. Leveraging device plugins like Better Rocket for further optimization, reducing node provisioning time to 51 seconds compared to 1 minute and 45 seconds before.
5. Implementing KV cache aware routing, prefill decoding disaggregation, and offloading KV cache from GPU into CPU memory for enhanced distributed inference performance.
6. Utilizing frameworks like Nvidia&#x27;s DNNGenie or AI Bricks for managing distributed inference efficiently.

The talk emphasizes the importance of continuous improvement, inviting feedback for future sessions.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation introduces Config, an approach to managing Kubernetes configurations as data rather than generating code and storing it in a database. This setup enables making configuration changes programmatically through functions, reducing errors associated with manual alterations of Kubernetes YAML files. Config supports built-in transforms for common adjustments like setting images or replica counts, and allows users to create custom functions for specific needs. These configurations can be validated before deployment using tools like Cube Conform or OPA, ensuring compliance with predefined policies. The speaker emphasizes separating data management from programmatic operations, aiming for safer and more streamlined Kubernetes deployments. This method encourages using existing tools like Flux, Argo, and Helm as packaging utilities while avoiding them for operational delivery tasks.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">This presentation introduces next-generation extension management in Kubernetes using image volumes for PostgreSQL (Postgrez) extensions. Key points include:

1. Packaging Postgrez extensions as OCI images enables mounting them into containers running Postgrez using the new image volume feature within Kubernetes.
2. The extension control path setting, introduced in Postgres 18, configures Postgres to look for extension files in mounted OCI images.
3. Benefits of this strategy include streamlined builds, development, and integration; improved security and supply chain management; and better extension discovery.
4. The approach allows PostgreSQL users to install specific extensions based on their database workload requirements rather than a one-size-fits-all solution.
5. The talk also highlights an additional use case: dynamically mounting validator libraries for OpenID Connect (OIDC)-based authentication methods, like OATH 2.0 (OATH-HCP).
6. Current focus is on Postgres 18 and beyond; backporting to older versions faces challenges due to the new extension control path setting&#x27;s requirement.
7. CI/CD pipelines benefit from this approach as developers can easily experiment with extensions without building full PostgreSQL servers, reducing testing friction.
8. Although not explicitly mentioned in the talk, leveraging existing OCI infrastructure for supply chain management of extension builds (e.g., signatures) is a potential future development.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses the use of cluster profiles as a mechanism for multicluster controllers, particularly schedulers, to distribute AI jobs across different clusters optimally utilizing GPU resources. The current system employs custom credentials and simple wiring but acknowledges the need for more robust features:

1. Standardized properties: The cluster profile API is open, allowing community contributions; however, there&#x27;s a call for standardization in useful properties through community input to enhance interoperability.
2. Plugin implementation method: Current practice involves baking plugins directly into Docker files, but the team seeks more preferred methods for plugin integration.
3. Documentation and resources: Improving documentation, providing examples, creating a plug-in registry or similar resource, would significantly aid community members in understanding and utilizing cluster profile plugging effectively.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The talk discusses an advanced failover mechanism, specifically the &quot;failover quorum&quot; feature in Cloud PostgreSQL (CloudPG), version 128. This feature is enabled by setting a &#x27;failover quorum&#x27; field to &#x27;true&#x27;, which prompts the operator to create a custom resource called failover quorum for the cluster. The operator then updates the posgus configuration and checks if an automated failover is possible using this new resource.

To ensure reliable automated failovers, CloudPG introduces two settings in posgus:
1. cpg synchronous standby names metadata: A JSON version of the synchronous standby name setting used by the instance manager to update the failover quorum setting.
2. cpg config hash 256: A hash of the configuration content, allowing the operator to verify if the postmaster has received and applied the new configuration.

Once the postmaster reads the new configuration, the operator updates the failover quorum object with the latest synchronous standby names metadata. This enables automated failovers only when connection conditions and the failover quorum requirements are met, ensuring strong consistency in posgus configurations before proceeding with an automated failover.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses an innovative data storage system architecture that integrates object storage for improved scalability, elasticity, and performance. This hybrid approach leverages remote object storage to manage heavy read queries, cold data, backups, and operation logs, reducing resource contention with online traffic, minimizing latency, and enhancing recovery speed. By utilizing cloud-agnostic object storage interfaces, the system can abstract differences between vendors like AWS S3 and Google Cloud Storage (GCS), ensuring seamless integration and operation. The key advantages lie in isolating read operations from regular data access, employing background jobs for non-latency-critical tasks, and optimizing storage usage through centralized compaction services. This architecture results in faster scale-out and scale-in processes, lower latency during peak loads, and reduced storage costs due to eviction of infrequently accessed data to remote object stores. The talk emphasizes the benefits of adopting such a flexible system design for businesses seeking enhanced performance and resource management capabilities.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presented content focused on updates and features of several open-source tools related to policy management, admission control, and compliance in Kubernetes:

1. OPA (Open Policy Agent) shared its 10th anniversary and discussed enhancements, including a new disk driver for improved export performance, integration with Validating Admission Controller (VIP), and the introduction of connection and syncset CRDs. OPA&#x27;s control plane project simplifies managing policy bundles across distributed environments.

2. Gatekeeper, an audit controller and admission controller using Cell and Rego policies, unveiled several updates:
   - A new disk driver for enhancing violation reporting throughput
   - Integration of Validating Admission Controller (VIP) features
   - Connection management CRD for exporting violations to various backends
   - Status and metrics added for external data features
   - Improvements in consistency between external data sources and gatekeeper&#x27;s admission control

3. The discussion also explored potential alternatives to the current in-memory policy storage, such as using databases like DynamoDB or custom solutions involving a separate database and OPA interacting with it via an API. However, no concrete proposals for such implementations were shared during this talk.

4. Users raised questions about real-time policy synchronization with user interfaces, suggesting that storing policies in databases might offer advantages but was not the current approach. The community was encouraged to explore these ideas further in the open-source tools&#x27; community Slack and GitHub issues.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Kubernetes deployments frequently expose applications to internet risks due to misconfigurations, often involving internet exposure and weak authentication. These misconfigurations can lead to cluster takeovers in cases of exploitation. While security has improved, popular applications still exhibit issues, with many origins tracing back to default settings rather than deliberate mistakes. Misconfigurations can be exploited within minutes post-deployment, posing significant threats. Over 50% of active container exploitations stem from misconfigurations, not software vulnerabilities alone. Tools like KNO, OPA, Cublin, and Truffle Hog can help mitigate these risks by enforcing policies, detecting anomalies in container behavior, and preventing the deployment of misconfigured applications during CI/CD pipelines.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The speaker discusses challenges in filtering API responses based on user permissions within Kubernetes, highlighting a technical impossibility due to the need for repeatability in the current architecture. They propose two potential solutions: token attenuation and client-side namespace discovery. Token attenuation involves obtaining a scoped token for specific tasks, which can be managed within Kubernetes. Client-side namespace discovery aims to create a tool that determines what the user can see and then makes targeted requests accordingly. The speaker emphasizes the need for more self-sufficient individuals or teams willing to develop these solutions, as they are open to making necessary shifts in the system&#x27;s design to accommodate diverse use cases. They invite participants with similar ideas to collaborate on improving Kubernetes&#x27; functionality. Additional questions revolve around auditability and potential integration of attenuation mechanisms into existing authentication processes for better tracking and compliance.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses strategies for optimizing machine learning inference performance and cost by focusing on three key areas: KV caching, GPU sharing, and observability. 

1. KV Caching: Implement tiered and distributed cache solutions to improve inference speed. Tiering involves storing frequently accessed data in faster memory tiers, while distribution allows for cache sharing across multiple nodes. This approach enhances overall performance and reduces latency.

2. GPU Sharing: Efficiently manage GPU resources by employing various scheduling tools like MIG (Multi-Instance GPU), Nvidia&#x27;s Kai Scheduler, or custom solutions. These tools help in parallelizing tasks, managing multi-tenant GPUs, and ensuring efficient resource allocation across clusters. 

3. Observability &amp; Profiling: Utilize profiling tools to gain insights into code behavior, resource consumption (CPU, GPU), and latency per request. This information helps identify bottlenecks, optimize configurations, and ultimately save costs. Implementing distributed tracing aids in understanding the flow of requests across clusters and identifying areas for improvement.

Additionally, the talk highlights challenges associated with distributed inference across geographically dispersed locations and different cloud providers. These include managing distributed attention kernels, ensuring consistent KV caching across nodes, optimizing pipeline communication, and implementing MOE (Multi-Objective Optimization) routing for efficient resource sharing. 

By focusing on these areas – optimizing KV caching, GPU sharing, and observability – organizations can enhance their machine learning inference performance while simultaneously reducing costs.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">AI agents on Kubernetes face challenges with context and state management, as traditional Kubernetes was not designed for agents. End users should begin by identifying specific use cases, such as resume filtering, and gradually work from those cases to more complex applications. They can start gaining experience with tool calling, as AI applications primarily involve translating questions into API calls and processing results. Building robust AI agents is crucial for handling increasing loads on the platform engineering team&#x27;s capacity. The community should collaborate on developing these agents to address this growing need.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Kazuki Yamamoto, a researcher at LT Corporation in Japan focusing on distributed systems and virtualization, introduces an execution model called &#x27;processing pipeline&#x27; for building high-performance AI/ML processing pipelines within ML life cycles. This approach aims to optimize performance per power consumption by assigning the most suitable hardware accelerator (like TPU or GPU) for each task in the dataflow.

The processing pipeline concept is rooted in a data-centric approach, allowing application users to focus on desired processing rather than managing infrastructure deployment. Yamamoto demonstrates this using NumaFlow, an open-source software providing a Kubernetes-native and serverless platform for deploying processing pipelines as manifests via Kubernetes.

The talk highlights two demos:
1. Updating the accelerator in an existing pipeline by modifying its manifest and deploying it with NumaFlow. This showcases switching between GPUs like T4 to A100, demonstrating seamless redeployment without application changes.
2. Upgrading inference models integrated into the ML life cycle using Kubeflow, involving registering a new model version in Kuberflow&#x27;s model registry and deploying an updated pipeline with NumaFlow. This demonstrates smooth integration of new model versions into running pipelines.

Yamamoto also discusses future work, focusing on reducing data transfer overhead between DPU tasks (unnecessary data movement by CPUs) and bridging the performance gap between accelerators and network speeds through a technique called &#x27;absorb chaining.&#x27; This method aims to optimize direct, high-speed communication paths between accelerators within Kubernetes using second networks.

The ongoing work includes proposing absorb chaining as a new feature for NumaFlow community support and integrating IP address management and memory resolution mechanisms for efficient second network usage within Kubernetes.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">This presentation introduces an open-source, cloud-native infrastructure for deploying and managing AI models, specifically tailored for preventative healthcare applications. The architecture includes Kubernetes for orchestration, Microsoft&#x27;s autogen for agentic framework, VLM (Vectorized Language Model) for model serving, and Prometheus with Grafana for observability. Models like Llama 3 and DeepSeek R1 are used but can be replaced with custom or fine-tuned models.

Key advantages highlighted include:
1. Reduced clinician workload by automating patient selection for screenings.
2. Cost-effectiveness, as it runs on both commodity x86 CPUs and GPUs, eliminating per-token API fees.
3. No vendor lock-in or unexpected charges from third parties like OpenAI or Hugging Face.

The system was tested with a synthetic data set but demonstrated potential with real patient datasets. The application uses natural language prompts for various agents and generates emails drafts based on screening prompts, with guardrails to ensure appropriate information delivery.

Regarding long-term maintenance, the speaker acknowledges the potential overhead involved in customizing and maintaining an open-source stack but emphasizes that organizations can mitigate this through skilled personnel or contractors. The talk also touches upon patient safety concerns, where guardrails were implemented to prevent model hallucinations and ensure appropriate information generation.

Lastly, the speaker encourages interested attendees to explore the application on Hugging Face and the full backend on GitHub, as well as utilizing AMD&#x27;s latest Instinct GPUs through the AMD developer cloud for $100 in cloud credits.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Longhorn, an open-source distributed file system and storage virtualization solution for containerized environments, is discussed in detail. The key points revolve around its architecture, improvements, and usage:

1. Longhorn&#x27;s design utilizes existing resources on cluster nodes for efficient block storage, supporting various network transports like TCP and ISCSI.
2. Version 5.0 introduced enhancements to the data plane using SPK (Simple Parallel Kernel), which provides improved latency characteristics compared to its predecessor.
3. Snapshot management is built-in, allowing users to create snapshots that record historical data but consume additional space. Longhorn recommends limiting snapshot numbers due to potential disk usage issues.
4. A recurring job manages periodic tasks such as backup creation, deletion, snapshot creation, deletion, clean up, and file system training.
5. In response to user feedback on read-write many (RWX) volume instability, Longhorn is working towards improving High Availability for RWX volumes in future releases.
6. A stretch cluster across two data centers can maintain separate Longhorn instances at each site without complications, as they are considered part of the same cluster when using appropriate tags and selectors.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The talk discusses the pros and cons of using out-of-cluster (incluster rendering) vs in-cluster (rendered manifest pattern) templating tools for deployment and management in Kubernetes environments. 

Out-of-cluster rendering tools, such as Helm and Customize, are easier to use, offer better local validation, and simpler health checks integrated with GitOps workflows. They&#x27;re ideal for most cases where rapid development and ease of understanding are prioritized. However, they lack deep cluster integration and may not perfectly reflect complex composite resources&#x27; internal states.

In-cluster rendering tools like Flux, on the other hand, require more setup but offer deeper cluster integration and built-in health checks through Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs). They enable better alignment with Kubernetes&#x27; native features but introduce extra complexity in terms of managing status fields and health checks manually for composite resources.

Eggmmont, a case study mentioned, uses both methods: simple Helm charts for most tasks, and rendered manifests for developer-facing applications using custom resources managed by tools like Crossplane or Flux. They&#x27;re hesitant to fully adopt in-cluster rendering due to added complexity and resource management overhead, especially for smaller teams.

The talk emphasizes that the choice between these approaches depends on team size, security requirements, development speed preferences, and the need for deep cluster integration versus ease of use and simplicity.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Reddus, used in Ago CD for caching, has CVE issues and a controversial license. Dragonfly is presented as an alternative, offering savings in memory usage by 9% to 3%. Cache is not critical for Ago CD operations, resulting in minimal downtime during migration. Dragonfly&#x27;s leader election differs from Reddus; it uses a controller that monitors clusters and determines the primary/secondary configuration. If the controller goes down, primary instance functionality continues as long as it&#x27;s running. Scalability allows for multiple controller replicas for increased redundancy. Dragonfly is considered production-ready, being GA (Generically Available), nearly 100% compatible with Reddus commands, and using the Reddus CLI internally.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses optimizing kernel parameters for efficient swap management in Linux nodes, particularly within Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) environments. Key points include:

1. Importance of early and gradual swapping for workload protection against home-grown killer (killer process) and application freezes due to insufficient min watermark levels.
2. Two crucial kernel parameters for swap control are the minimum free memory reserve (min_free_kbytes in /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes) and the watermark scale factor (wmappm in sysctl.conf).
3. Adjusting min_free_kbytes lifts the safety buffer for the kernel, while the wmappm scale factor determines when swap starts acting proactively.
4. Proper tuning of these parameters helps prevent application evictions and reduces the likelihood of home-grown killer activations.
5. A larger min_free_kbytes reserve provides more room for swap to operate, while a higher wmappm scale factor widens the runway for early swapping.
6. Faster storage setups like NVME-backed swap can facilitate graceful workload swapping without invoking killer processes or causing abrupt terminations.
7. Kubernetes eviction thresholds should be tuned to account for swap usage, as it is currently not considered in the eviction process, potentially leading to incorrect workloads being evicted.
8. Swapping activity and IO activity are visible with GKE, as they can be captured at pod, container, and node levels using Kubernetes metrics.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Ital, a leading Latin American bank with over 18,000 developers, has been modernizing its IT infrastructure by transitioning from on-premise to private and now public cloud environments. Aiming for full cloud integration by 2028, they&#x27;ve integrated multiple disciplines such as design, technology, upgrades, methodology, data, and artificial intelligence. This approach has resulted in significant improvements: a 99% reduction in high-impact incidents, 65% increase in technological changes and updates, and a 45% cost decrease for transactions.

To maintain this momentum, Ital created a platform centered on four principles: Developer journey, product experimentation, standardization, and runtimes. The Developer journey emphasizes golden paths for developers to ensure velocity with quality and security while focusing on delivering business value. Product experimentation enables rapid idea testing to minimize risk using feature flags, AB testing, and telemetry data for informed decision-making.

Standardization involves implementing consistent building blocks across services, facilitating automated environments and faster local development. This platform comprises a control manager, control planes, and data planes. The robust control manager orchestrates various control planes, which are distributed, multi-tenant Kubernetes-based entities focusing on different technical capacities (database, messaging, applications).

The runtimes, stateless, isolated, elastic, and lifecycle-automated data plane environments cater to specific resource needs like containers or databases. The application data plane, for instance, contains multiple Kubernetes clusters with namespaces containing business services, ensuring each namespace is self-contained for a given service.

Key implementation elements include Kong for API gateway, OPA for policy enforcement, Argo and Crossplane for deployment management, Helm for package management, and DataDog and ETS for observability within namespaces. These components work together to automate runtime creation, destruction, relocation, and maintenance, ensuring minimal human intervention in these processes.

The benefits of this platform include streamlined developer journeys, efficient product experimentation, standardization, and resilient runtime environments. Ital aims for improved resource efficiency, enhanced operational overhead management, and increased business value creation through its platform engineering initiative.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Jane Doe explains the evolution of Git-based workflows in software deployment, focusing on the integration of Object Cloud Interfaces (OCIs) with tools like Argo and Flux for enhanced artifact distribution. She highlights two primary workflows:

1. Incremental updates synced via tags or branches, similar to current Git practices, but suited for airgapped networks or offline environments due to OCI&#x27;s performance and redundancy benefits.
2. Fully immutable deployments using tools like Cargo, which detect new OCIs and update the target revision in application specifications, ensuring consistent deployment of specific versions.

Doe emphasizes that organizations requiring supply chain metadata verification can benefit from OCI, despite Argo&#x27;s recent support limitations. She concludes by discussing the convergence of source control and artifact distribution as a new phase of software development workflows, anticipating further evolution in this space.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">1. Pod disruption conditions can cause pods to terminate unexpectedly, leading to potential issues in production environments. It&#x27;s essential to understand these conditions and implement eviction interception mechanisms using webhooks for custom eviction policies when standard Policy Based Admission Controllers (PDBs) are insufficient.
2. The kubelet and taint-based eviction can mistakenly terminate pods due to various reasons, such as heartbeats not being reported or node health checks failing. This issue can be mitigated by implementing guardrails for deleting nodes and using separate controllers for managing nodes&#x27; lifecycle.
3. Pod garbage collection (GC) controller can cause problems when deleting nodes, leading to orphaned pods that remain in a running state until they time out and are terminated abruptly. Implementing proper node lifecycle management is crucial to prevent such situations.
4. Eviction thresholds can be adjusted to control pod evictions better, but it&#x27;s essential to understand the implications of changing these settings. Disaster recovery drills involving taking down the control plane help assess pod behavior during terminal state terminations and identify any necessary adjustments in toleration settings or PTBs.
5. In case a single pod reaches a terminal state and stays there, it can lead to an accumulation of finished pods, potentially causing resource exhaustion. Familiarity with the controllers responsible for cleaning up these pods is essential for maintaining system stability.
6. The talk emphasizes the importance of monitoring audit logs and events to debug issues related to pod evictions, ensuring that custom eviction interceptors are functioning as intended when implemented.
7. Lastly, the speaker encourages attendees to explore their understanding of Kubernetes in-depth by joining the Kubernetes info team at LinkedIn for potential job opportunities.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Key Points and Main Takeaways:

1. The discussion revolves around issues with Open EBS (Elastic Block Storage) in Kubernetes, specifically concerning volume placement across multiple nodes within a stateful set using topology spreading constraints. There is a concern that the current setup does not correctly support bind-on-mount (BoM), causing replicas to share the same persistent volume and end up on the same node when scaling the deployment. The suggested solution involves confirming with Open EBS if this behavior is intended or if there&#x27;s an overlooked configuration issue.

2. Another question pertains to the problem of volume mounts being removed even when pods are not properly terminated, leading to data loss and application downtime in a CSI (Container Storage Interface) environment using FUSE file systems. The speaker mentions that current solutions involve emission webhooks or logging to nodes for manual pod killing. However, these methods don&#x27;t address the root cause of improper finalizers preventing volume removal during pod deletion.

3. There is interest in implementing a more robust solution, potentially an API webhook, which could intercept and block deletion requests for volumes mounted by pods with unfinalized resources or through finalizer chains. This would prevent accidental pod kills that lead to volume removal and subsequent data loss. The speaker acknowledges discussions about this feature but mentions no current implementation in production.

4. Additionally, there was a mention of two different architectures developed by the speaker&#x27;s team for managing resource allocation and lifecycle coordination in CSI environments with FUSE file systems. While one architecture is currently in use (with pros and cons), they are discussing another off-line, which might offer a more comprehensive solution to volume management issues arising from CSI upgrades and FUSE process updates.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">This presentation showcases Dapper, an open-source workflow engine designed for building serverless architectures using Kubernetes and container orchestration platforms. Key features include:

1. Local development environment: Developers can run Dapper locally using Docker or other container engines, making it easy to integrate with various languages like .NET and Java.
2. Component abstraction: Dapper&#x27;s component-based architecture allows for easy switching between components (e.g., append state stores) during different environments, ensuring seamless transitions from local development to production.
3. Resiliency and retries: Built-in retry mechanisms with customizable policies handle transient failures, while compensating actions ensure data consistency in case of failures.
4. OpenFGA for access control: Dapper utilizes OpenFGA (Access Control List) specifications to enforce fine-grained permissions, which can be converted into actionable strings using custom logic for applications.
5. Performance: Although the Dapper workflow engine operates within a sidecar setup in Kubernetes pods, it performs efficiently, especially with databases like PostgreSQL. Best practices recommend using databases optimized for performance when deploying across multiple pods and sidecars.
6. Fault tolerance and rollbacks: In case of failures, the system will attempt retries as per configured policies before ultimately throwing an exception. This leads to a compensating action loop that rolls back any uncompleted tasks, ensuring data integrity.
7. Testing capabilities: Dapper integrates with testing frameworks like Test Containers, enabling comprehensive automated testing during development and deployment stages.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses methods for ensuring Model Integrity, Security, and Trustworthiness in Machine Learning (ML). Key points include:

1. Tools like ModelScan, Atla (Intel&#x27;s project), and potential future tools can analyze ML models for vulnerabilities, including AI poisoning attacks.
2. Model cards provide transparency into a model&#x27;s training data, intended use cases, and ethical considerations. However, these do not currently offer certification of the training dataset’s ethical sourcing.
3. The presented workflow involves scanning models at different stages – during development (model inspection), serialization or deployment (model verification on disk), and runtime (potential fuzzing for unexpected outputs).
4. ModelScan provides estimated results based on layer analysis, while Atla offers end-to-end security solutions from data processing to model deployment, ensuring trusted ML pipelines.
5. Debugging ML models is still an undeveloped area compared to traditional software, with limited tools available for stepping through and understanding ML&#x27;s logic.
6. The threat of AI bombs (using pre-trained models maliciously) exists, as evidenced by tools like bombctl, which can create such attacks. However, there are no specific solutions or CA authorities dedicated to this issue beyond general security measures.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses Distributed Resource Allocation (DRA) in Kubernetes, focusing on the NVIDIA driver as an example. It outlines the steps to install and utilize the NVIDIA driver for GPU resource management:

1. Set up a Kind cluster with at least 8 CPUs and 16 GB of RAM using a bash script available on the GitHub repository.
2. Install the NVIDIA driver by deploying the NVDLOP-CTRL pod, which handles device plugin configuration.
3. Create a resource claim for GPUs in the Kubernetes cluster; two pods can now access GPU8 (GPU0) and GPU9 simultaneously due to shared resources.
4. Utilize DRA to manage CPU and GPU resources by creating resource claim templates linked to jobs, allowing for better alignment of workloads with available hardware.
5. Briefly touch upon other DRA drivers, including those for CPUs from AMD and FFOSA AI, as well as NVIDIA&#x27;s upcoming device plugins for various types of hardware.
6. Mention that the presented bash script can be reused for future walkthroughs, as it hasn&#x27;t been removed from the GitHub page.
7. Acknowledge that time slicing is the default method for DRA with GPUs but other methods, like using vGPUs or network-attached devices, are possible and under development.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discussed methods for generating metrics from complex traces at scale, focusing on two approaches: Bundler and Lazy DFS. The Bundler preemptively groups trace bundles together, creating a memory map of state to facilitate full DFS execution. This approach ensures comprehensive metrics but has the risk of losing data if the Bundler crashes.

The Lazy DFS, on the other hand, only sends information about partial fans when encountering rules, reducing resource usage and addressing load imbalance. However, it&#x27;s more prone to delays due to increased gossip messages over Kafka for deep chained fans. The talk emphasized selecting the best approach based on operational knowledge of the traces at hand and highlighted the importance of end-to-end latency monitoring in microservices environments.

The system uses a custom Kafka message queue with partitions hashed by trace IDs, enabling targeted message routing to specific Dagger instances. Currently, rule matching is based on attributes without relying solely on text or REACT. The presentation touched upon span metrics and their limitations for end-to-end measurements across different traces and fans, suggesting a desire to incorporate service mesh solutions like span generators for more comprehensive top-level operation metrics.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Andrea Chomiak, from Dash0, emphasizes the importance of design in making complex observability data usable for engineers. She describes common pain points, such as overwhelming dashboards during incidents leading to confusion and blaming technology when the actual issue might be poorly presented data. Chomiak outlines key design principles for enhancing observability tools:

1. Clear Information Hierarchy: Organize content using size, color, and alignment to guide users&#x27; attention to the most important aspects first. Avoid information overload by revealing complexity progressively based on user needs.

2. Progressive Disclosure: Structure data as a story, starting with an event and gradually unveiling more details only when required. This approach allows users to follow the narrative without being overwhelmed initially.

3. Visual Grouping: Employ proximity, similarity by shape, color, or size, and group related elements to improve cognitive processing. Coherent visual grouping helps users navigate information more efficiently.

4. Opinionated Default: Define sensible defaults based on common user needs and pain points. Offer contextual help alongside these defaults to assist users in making better choices without being overly restrictive.

5. Contextual Help: Provide timely, relevant assistance within the tool itself rather than relying on external resources. This can include inline instructions, inline error messages, and AI-powered conversational guidance for incident investigation and configuration support.

Chomiak stresses that designing observability tools is not just about aesthetics but ensuring they remain usable under pressure. Encourages collaboration between designers and engineers to co-create better tools by providing early feedback, empathizing with users&#x27; experiences, especially during stressful incidents. Ultimately, effective design in observability transforms raw data into clear insights for engineers to make informed decisions swiftly.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The talk emphasizes the evolving landscape of AI, particularly focusing on Machine Learning Systems Security (MLSec) and Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI). The speaker highlights that the proliferation of various AI tools, including MCP (Model-as-a-Service), LLMs (Large Language Models), GenAI, and their diverse applications, necessitates tailored governance strategies.

Key takeaways include:
1. AI encompasses a wide range of use cases, each with unique risks requiring distinct management practices – this is exemplified by the term &quot;hydra,&quot; signifying multiple heads to be controlled.
2. Developers are increasingly integrating code into software development processes for AI, leading to an emerging need for secure coding practices in MLSec contexts. The speaker mentions a free course available through Linux Foundation Education that addresses these concerns.
3. While traditional AI governance is well-established, the unique challenges of GenAI require organizations to adapt existing practices or develop new ones. This involves understanding data models and their deployment alongside software code, extending principles from conventional code governance to encompass data aspects.
4. The speaker acknowledges that certain insurance organizations and financial institutions are already developing robust frameworks for governing AI use, incorporating controls on model adoption, internal usage, and external service engagement.

The talk encourages organizations to learn from these patterns and adapt their governance strategies to effectively manage the complexities introduced by both MLSec and GenAI technologies.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Archer, a platform at Pinterest, implements fine grained access control (FGAC) for workloads using temporary credentials and scoped access via AWS&#x27;s IMDS, intercepting calls to IMDS and managing SDS token vending. This process involves setting annotations on jobs, including environment, user information, and an implicit IMRO (IM Role Object Reference), along with a legacy IMRO without attached policies.

The FGAC configuration is managed through LDAP group mappings, which are statically defined in the system&#x27;s codebase, undergoing review processes for updates. Pod certificates issued by Normandy enable service-to-service communication and identity verification.

FGAC supports both human users (with service accounts) and jobs as identities, with user authentication relying on AWS SDKs, ensuring transparency for users. The team considered various open-source alternatives but chose a custom solution for its transparency and suitability to their infrastructure.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">This presentation introduces a method for managing workloads across multiple Kubernetes clusters using MultiQ, a tool that allows abstraction of workload placement and aggregation. Key aspects include:

1. API aggregation object: Defines what type of resource (core or CRD) and its scope at the multicluster level.
2. Scalability: Different MultiQ instances can be deployed across clusters, with virtual markers indicating originating cluster for enhanced routing flexibility.
3. Reconciliation: MultiQ synchronizes both the specification and status between clusters to maintain consistency.
4. Custom placement logic: The community is working on extending multiq&#x27;s abilities to support custom placement strategies, like tainting a cluster for maintenance purposes.
5. Dashboard compatibility: The Kubernetes dashboard can function with MultiQ enabled by utilizing one cluster&#x27;s API configuration as if it were the sole cluster.
6. MultiQ architecture: Two primary components run - Q Manager Controller and Q - each instance using separate Cube configs pointing to their respective cluster&#x27;s API servers. Q in each underlying cluster manages workloads, ensuring resource availability for admission.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">1. Observability in AI applications requires a holistic view, but not everyone needs to see all details; roles within teams dictate required information. Product managers care about system behavior and performance metrics, while engineers might focus on throughput or uptime. New tools cater specifically to AI observability.
2. The talk emphasizes the importance of agent traces for understanding AI application behavior, highlighting the need for specialized evaluation (eval) tools. These are separate from general-purpose monitoring systems.
3. Rewrite strategies in AI involve a dichotomy between durable and disposable code:
   - Durable code is foundational, crucial, and requires caution due to its importance; examples include operating systems or databases.
   - Disposable code refers to front-end applications like websites or documentation platforms, easily rebuilt but less critical if compromised.
4. AI can assist in understanding complex, obsolete codebases (durable) or iterating on disposable parts of an application rapidly, but complete rewrites aren&#x27;t yet common practice due to complexity and risks involved.
5. Adopting a durable-disposable code strategy helps teams manage their AI applications better, leveraging AI for both understanding and evolving components as needed.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">1. The talk introduces Ambient Multicluster functionality in Istio, currently in alpha stage, requiring user testing and feedback for stability. This architecture allows services within and across clusters to communicate securely with network telemetry features like outlier detection, weighted routing, and failover.
2. To implement a default deny policy, users should first gather network telemetry data to understand service dependencies and allow traffic accordingly through selective allow policies. External resources should then be limited using similar policies. The final step involves deploying a default deny policy by creating an SEO operation policy targeting the gateway class &#x27;STGO waypoint&#x27;, which denies all traffic not explicitly allowed, ensuring precedence over allow policies.
3. The talk also emphasizes the importance of community engagement for Istio&#x27;s continuous improvement. Users are encouraged to join Slack communities, provide feedback, and participate in discussions to ensure the project&#x27;s development aligns with user needs. A QR code is provided for easy access to these channels, inviting participants to share their thoughts on the presented features.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Maxime Coquerel, a principal cloud security architect at the Royal Bank of Canada, presents a novel approach to threat modeling in Kubernetes using Lightweight Learning Models (LLM) and Small Language Models (SLM), specifically focusing on Fast Proactive Modeling (FPM). The traditional method of threat modeling, while crucial for identifying potential risks and misconfigurations, is often time-consuming and not easily scalable, especially for small teams or rapidly evolving infrastructure.

Coquerel identifies two primary challenges: the lengthy process, sometimes taking up to three weeks, and the frequent need to revisit models as infrastructure changes. To address these issues, he proposes a solution leveraging LLMs and SLMs, such as FIFO on Amazon Olam. This system involves building a comprehensive knowledge base—a collection of past threat models, best practices, guidelines, and other relevant documentation—which is then fed into the LLM via an open web UI platform like Chromad.

The LLM processes this information, categorizes threats based on predefined methodologies, and prioritizes them using a score derived from the chosen risk assessment framework. The output can be presented in JSON format for seamless integration with version control systems like GitHub or other repositories. By automating threat modeling exercises, this approach drastically reduces the time required to conduct a thorough analysis, shrinking it from weeks to just a few days—and offers full traceability between architecture, threats, and controls.

Moreover, since the knowledge base can be continuously updated with new technical documents, the solution also supports rerunning threat modeling exercises as needed. Coquerel emphasizes that this LLM-based approach serves as an assistant for cloud security architects rather than a replacement, enabling them to create more accurate first drafts of threat models quickly and efficiently.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Christine Kim introduces Gateway API as an ingress replacement, emphasizing its role-oriented design and portability across different implementations. Key features include URL-based and header-based routing for route management, traffic splitting to direct traffic between versions, and support for both north-south (external/internal) and east-west (intra-cluster) traffic management via CRDs.

To utilize Gateway API as an end user, one must select a gateway controller, install Gateway Resource Definitions (CRDs), deploy the gateway with desired configuration, and apply HTTP routes. Conformance to Gateway API requires passing tests provided for each release.

Two notable tools facilitating interaction with Gateway API are Ingress-to-Gateway, which translates ingress resources into Gateway API counterparts, and Gateway Cuddle, a visualization tool for understanding gateway resource connections and interrelations. The Gateway community welcomes user feedback on potential features and encourages participation in discussions through GitHub issues and the SIG network group.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Ingress EngineX, a long-standing Kubernetes ingress solution, is transitioning to maintenance mode due to a lack of active maintainers and resources. The project has been undergoing dependency updates and minor releases but no significant feature additions or major fixes since London&#x27;s CubeCon in March 2021. The project will be officially archived by March 2026, with ongoing support for existing deployments but no further development or new features.

The speakers emphasize the project&#x27;s historical significance and extensive contributions from over 8,000 contributors across 1,000 distinct individuals throughout its decade-long existence. They attribute the decline in community involvement to a lack of awareness regarding the effort required to maintain such an expansive open-source project and the time-consuming nature of releases.

With the deprecation of Ingress EngineX, SIG Network recommends migrating to the Gateway API for ingress management. A gateway-to-ingress project is being developed to assist in this transition. The speakers thank everyone who contributed to keeping Ingress EngineX alive and encourage those interested in facilitating a smoother migration to Gateway API to join the Ingress to Gateway project&#x27;s development efforts. They also acknowledge that Kubernetes&#x27; success can be partly attributed to this integral ingress solution, underscoring its importance for the ecosystem&#x27;s evolution.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">John Hune, a software engineer at Microsoft focusing on upstream Kubernetes projects, introduces the DRA (Dynamic Resource Allocation) concept as an efficient method to utilize hardware in clusters, particularly beneficial for workloads requiring specialized resources like GPUs or TPUs. He explains that DRA is implemented through new APIs within Kubernetes to define resource requirements for pods and match them with available devices. This process mirrors the existing persistent volume system.

To help users familiarize themselves with DRA, Jon introduces the DRA example driver—a simple yet comprehensive tool enabling Kubernetes clusters, even Kind clusters on laptops, to act as a DRA sandbox. Users can create resource claims for mock GPUs and experiment with device configuration, sharing, and integration with containers via examples provided in the repository.

The DRA example driver serves as an excellent testing ground for Kubernetes ecosystem integrations such as autoscaling, batch scheduling, and projects like Slinky that aim to bring slurm workload management to Kubernetes. It also facilitates testing new DRA features like partitionable devices or consumable capacity.

Jon encourages the community to share feedback on desired feature demonstrations within the example driver, fostering continuous improvement. He invites participants to join discussions in the working group device management Slack channel or directly contact him via GitHub/Slack for assistance with DRA or the example driver.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation introduces an open-source AI-powered observability system, designed to address the challenges of overwhelming yet uninterpretable data in AI infrastructure monitoring. This solution, developed by Twinkle Sisodia at Red Hat, focuses on providing non-ops users with immediate AI insights into model and cluster behavior, along with data point correlations. The system leverages an MCP server, integrated with the Llama stack (Kerlm for model deployment), Prometheus, Tempo, and Lock for observability data collection, and Correlator for data correlation.

The user-friendly interface allows direct interaction with data sources using natural language queries via a chat feature, converting them into PromQL queries and fetching results from various sources like Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Tempo. The system then applies statistical analysis and machine learning models to generate contextualized insights, encompassing performance summaries, trends, patterns, recommended actions, and business-relevant details beyond just engineering troubleshooting.

The demo showcases a user-friendly interface where users can select namespaces, time periods, and analyze model or Prometheus metrics. The tool also demonstrates advanced query capabilities, such as identifying pods entering crash loop back off status with detailed pod information, catering to both engineering and business stakeholders. This innovative approach aims to streamline AI infrastructure monitoring by converting complex raw data into actionable AI-driven insights.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discussed several enhancements to Kubernetes&#x27; command-line tool, ckubectlc, focusing on credential management and security. Key points include:

1. New &quot;exec provider&quot; configuration in client go for specifying binary authorization policies via a QRC file or REST config, allowing users to control which binaries can fetch credentials on their behalf.
2. The implementation allows specifying allow lists (all, deny all, or specific allowed binaries) and supports both minimal names and absolute paths of binaries.
3. Concerns about multiple binaries with the same name were addressed by relying on exec.look path&#x27;s resolution process. Duplicates are currently merged in this resolution but won&#x27;t cause errors.
4. Alternative security measures for preventing unauthorized binary execution, such as signature verification, were suggested to relieve concerns about malicious cube config files.
5. Pod certificate API was highlighted, emphasizing its use with trusted signers (fully qualified domain names) and avoiding conflicts with internal PKIs or private certificate authorities.
6. Plans for built-in signers by the Kubernetes project to ensure non-conflicting trust were mentioned, alongside a reminder about proper management of signer names within SER.
7. The speakers encouraged attendees to ask further questions as they remained available post-presentation.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation emphasizes the creation and management of operators using Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) in Kubernetes. Operators, in this context, refer to software that extends the functionality of a Kubernetes cluster by automating complex tasks. The speaker highlights several key aspects:

1. CRDs enable the definition of new types of resources within Kubernetes, acting as extension points for custom functionality.
2. Operators are applications that manage these CRDs, automating processes and maintaining the desired state of resources.
3. For self-service portals, a facade or abstraction layer is often required to simplify complex workflows involving multiple operators. The speaker introduces Cratics.io as an example tool for composing operators using promises, which are custom resource types representing high-level services or functionalities.
4. When organizations implement multiple IDPs (Identity and Access Management systems), the complexity increases, leading to a need for more advanced management solutions that can oversee various platforms simultaneously.
5. The speaker encourages attendees to complete a survey, which will contribute to the betterment of the developer community. They also invite questions and a demo scheduled for 45 minutes in booth 430.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Pranay Prateek, co-founder and maintainer at Signos, delivers a lightning talk on tracing untraceable components of &#x27;vibe-coded&#x27; LLM (Language Model) applications using OpenTelemetry. He emphasizes the importance of observability in LLMs, which are often black boxes due to their runtime complexities.

Key takeaways from Prateek&#x27;s presentation:

1. OpenTelemetry is a powerful open-source observability platform that integrates traces, metrics, and logs into a single pane, making it the second fastest-growing project in the Cloud Native Foundation (CNCF), following Kubernetes.

2. The primary advantage of OpenTelemetry lies in its vendor-agnostic nature; it offers complete instrumentation freedom without relying on proprietary solutions. This makes it an ideal choice for monitoring LLMs and other complex applications.

3. Prateek demonstrates how to trace a Signos MCP (Monitoring Controller Plane) instance connected to a Langchain-based LLM app, showcasing potential bottlenecks within the system. These bottlenecks can arise from various components such as the LLM application itself, the MCP server, or the model being used by the LLM.

4. By utilizing OpenTelemetry&#x27;s real-time capabilities, you can monitor factors like latency (P95), error rates, tool call distribution, and alert notifications for multiple services, dashboards, and calls. This allows developers to proactively identify issues in a production environment without relying on third-party tools or libraries.

5. Implementing robust alerts and guardrails using OpenTelemetry can help pinpoint areas of misbehavior within LLMs, enabling faster troubleshooting and improved user experiences. By understanding system bottlenecks, developers can make informed decisions to optimize their applications&#x27; performance.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Arsh Sharma, a member of Metalbear, presents his journey into the Kubernetes ecosystem, focusing on his experience with data structures and algorithms (DSA). He shares his initial frustration with DSA in university, viewing it as a mere interview prep tool devoid of practical application. His disdain for grinding through DSA problems led him to open-source projects, where he encountered a Kubernetes dependency management task using Go&#x27;s `go mod graph`. This realization sparked his interest in learning DSA, albeit with a newfound purpose – building something tangible.

Metalbear&#x27;s team developed a tool that utilized directly directed acyclic graphs (DDAGs) to visualize project dependencies, counting both direct and transitive dependencies. This tool became an integral CI job in the Kubernetes project, providing maintainers valuable insights into the impact of pull requests on project dependencies. Seeing this tool in action, with real-world implications, transformed Arsh&#x27;s relationship from a love-hate one to a respectful appreciation for DSA.

Arsh concludes by showcasing the stunning dependency graph of the entire Kubernetes project, a visual representation that encapsulates the end result of their efforts – an intricate web connecting various components and dependencies. He encourages the audience to connect with him on social media or try the tool via the provided link for further exploration. A sleeping hat related to his team&#x27;s project is also available for those who wish to engage further at booth 1560.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In this lightning talk, Jennifer Weir emphasizes the importance of identity diversity in cloudnative experiences, particularly for young first-generation females and newcomers. She shares her personal journey, starting with container hacking in student clubs before Kubernetes and CNCF came into focus. Weir highlights that discomfort in diverse environments can be a catalyst for growth but becomes detrimental when prolonged, affecting social and professional interactions.

She underscores the power of identity diversity, citing research from &quot;The Diversity Bonus: How Great Teams Pay Off in the Knowledge Economy.&quot; This diversity multiplies cognitive strengths, leading to superior performance on complex tasks compared to homogeneous groups. Weir encourages embracing unique identities and perspectives as superpowers, rather than barriers, fostering a culture that values all contributions based on merit and conduct.

The speaker points out the benefits of identity diversity in complex systems, such as open-source communities, where varied viewpoints create more inclusive design decisions and solutions tailored to global user needs. Research indicates that underrepresented groups&#x27; absence leads to lower financial performance, making diversity a strategic advantage rather than an exception.

Weir advocates for creating space in open-source communities for diverse voices, ensuring everyone has a seat at the table. This inclusivity not only improves outcomes but also accelerates innovation and strengthens technologies, making them ubiquitous and accessible to all. The CNCF, with its 297,000 contributors, exemplifies this inclusive ethos – a goal that must continuously be pursued for the full realization of cloudnative advancements.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Jeffrey Ying, a Google software engineer, discusses the importance of graceful controller operations in Kubernetes, focusing on the cube controller manager (cube) and cubeuler components. He highlights the issue of split brain scenarios when multiple instances of these controllers coexist, leading to inconsistent cluster states due to differing opinions on desired state. To address this, Ying explains the use of leader election, where one instance becomes an active leader and holds a lease lock while others monitor it. The leader instance runs control loops, but if it fails or loses leadership, it exits, causing problems like skipped clean-up operations, go routine leaks, and inefficient graceful transitions.

To tackle these challenges, Google has made the cube controller manager (KCM) more graceful. This enhancement involves performing cleanup operations before shutting down and fixing go routine leaks to ensure a safe release of lock. As a result, new controllers can adopt this pattern for smoother transitions and additional features like voluntary locking. Ying encourages developers to build better, more graceful controllers by adopting these practices.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Cubert, an operator extending Kubernetes API server to run virtual machines alongside pods, is progressing significantly. Adopting Kubernetes concepts like SIGs (Special Interest Groups), Cubert has established compute, storage, networking, and confidential computing SIGs. The control plane SIG focuses on shared project components such as controllers and APIs.

In 2023, Cubert experienced a 17% increase in attendees at its annual summit, with 12 sessions from various organizations. To streamline development and ensure quality releases, the project adopted Kubernetes&#x27; Enhancement Proposal (EP) process. Developers now need to submit design proposals at the beginning of the development cycle, followed by review, refinement during development, stabilization, and eventual merging of pull requests based on approved designs.

Key features introduced this year include decentralized live migration for VMs between namespaces and clusters, enhanced priority queue in migration controllers, support for Intel TDX and AMDSVS confidential computing, and initial DRRA (Data Replication and Recovery) capabilities through a dedicated working group.

Optimizations were made to the IOT thread tuning API and past network binding support was added for seamless TCP migration during live migration. Native OCI image volume mounting using Cubert&#x27;s virtual machines and swap space configuration on nodes improved system stability.

For the future, Cubert aims to expand multiple hypervisor support beyond KVM, integrating with Microsoft MSHV and leveraging Kubernetes plug-in mechanisms for safe extension without destabilizing clusters. Incremental VM backups using CBT (Checkpoint and Consistency Technology), VGPU live migration, PCI NUMA topology awareness, enhanced integration with DRA, and native virtual machine templates are among the ongoing developments.

The community is encouraged to participate in discussions via Slack or by exploring the Cubert community page for more information on involvement.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Muhammad, a senior DevOps engineer at ARAB CENTER FOR RESEARCH &amp; POLICY STUDIES and Kubernetes maintainer, presents updates on SIKKES infrastructure managing Kubernetes projects&#x27; cloud resources. The SIKKES infra runs three key services: an image registry, a CI system, and a download service. They&#x27;ve experienced leadership changes this year with Benjamin Elder and Dims stepping down, replaced by Dylan Paige (CNCF Infrastructure Tag chair and Kative maintainer) and Crian Hackman (COPS maintainer).

dl.k.io, where users download Kubernetes binaries, handles substantial data traffic—3.5PB/month via Fastly&#x27;s CDN with 120 requests/second and 11.5GBps throughput, boasting a 95% cache hit ratio. Register.io serves as a central image repository for core Kubernetes and various JSON projects; it operates on Google Cloud (22 regions) and AWS (11 regions), reducing data origin traffic significantly.

The SIG is now collaborating with IBM and Datadog, receiving Kubernetes build clusters for s390x and ppc64 architectures from IBM—historical testing partners—and cloud cost observability, security tools, and synthetic testing from Datadog. These improvements aim to enhance CI speed and efficiency while ensuring transparent resource utilization through public dashboards.

The team is continually optimizing the CI process by migrating from older Google N1 VMs to newer machines, resulting in faster job execution times of around 45 minutes for Kubernetes pull requests compared to one hour previously—all without code changes. They&#x27;re also planning similar upgrades for EKS clusters, targeting newer machine generations as they become available.

Muhammad invites interested individuals to join the SIKKES infrastructure SIG on Kubernetes Slack and encourages further contributions and involvement from Cloud Engineers and Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) keen on cloud infrastructure tasks. The SIG meets every other week, with meeting times varying based on global time zones.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The organization emphasizes managing Kubernetes resources at scale using Argo Workflows and Argo CD. They&#x27;ve developed a pattern where the main workflow orchestrates subworkflows, promoting modularity and maintaining separation of concerns. This helps avoid conflicts between teams handling different aspects of deployments. They also discuss challenges with the Argo UI, particularly regarding hidden nodes in workflows with numerous parallel steps, which they resolved by encouraging the use of child workflows with appropriate labels for better visibility. Additionally, they mention difficulties with customizable UI buttons, such as the log archive button and the terminate workflow button, which were addressed through workarounds like creating a Chrome plug-in to remove the terminate button. The primary focus is on maintaining stability, quickly iterating, and ensuring seamless operations, rather than frequently pushing new features or applications.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation outlines various strategies to reduce cold start latency in GPU-based inference, highlighting techniques such as:

1. Model and tokenizer caching within Docker images for faster startup.
2. Lazy loading, where only essential components load during the first request.
3. Warming up GPUs using pre-warm pools of servers.
4. Optimizing serialization formats like PyTorch&#x27;s safe tensors and ONNX to reduce serialization time.
5. Utilizing GPU state snapshotting for faster initialization.
6. Employing memory mapping techniques for models.

The choice of technique depends on factors such as cost, performance requirements, and the specific workload. Smaller teams with budget constraints often prioritize methods reducing cold start latency. These strategies apply not only to serverless GPUs but also to on-premises setups, given that CUDA context initialization and memory transfer are common challenges across both environments.

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The discussion revolves around enhancing software supply chain security within the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) ecosystem. Key points include:

1. Current practices in supply chain security vary, with some projects lacking designated security champions and sufficient resources for ongoing vulnerability management.
2. Generative technology could potentially streamline security processes across projects.
3. Clear communication of a project&#x27;s security posture is crucial but often overlooked, especially for consumers operating in regulated industries or handling sensitive data.
4. Not all CNCF projects need to adhere to an extreme security standard, as their purpose may not necessitate it. For instance, shell escapes in projects designed to run arbitrary code might have different security requirements than those built for payment processing.
5. The TOC (Technical Oversight Committee) and tags underneath them play a role in identifying concerns and proposing solutions, but more could be done to bridge the gap between initiatives and actual project implementation.
6. Encouraging projects to understand their security postures and clearly communicate these would benefit both maintainers and users alike.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The talk emphasizes that open source projects require additional value beyond the free software itself to ensure sustainability and long-term success. This value can be security, support, maintenance, or other features that address user needs. Vendors contributing to open source can benefit in various ways, including enhancing their reputation, fostering community involvement, and securing their business interests by aligning with successful projects.

The talk also discusses different methods for adding value:
1. Direct contributions: Companies can directly contribute code, fix bugs, or develop new features.
2. Support and maintenance: Providing professional support, bug fixing, and continuous maintenance can add significant value.
3. Education and training: Offering educational resources, workshops, and training programs can benefit the community and project users.
4. Infrastructure and services: Building related infrastructure or services can create synergy with open source projects.
5. Contractual contributions: Vendors may choose to contribute code under specific licenses (e.g., AGPL) to ensure that improvements are always available, preventing them from becoming proprietary.

The talk highlights the importance of understanding and respecting open-source license terms while recognizing their utility in different contexts. The speaker advises against rigid adherence to a particular license type, emphasizing that businesses should focus on aligning with the spirit and goals of the chosen license rather than just the legal restrictions.

The talk also addresses the balance between open-source projects and proprietary offerings from vendors, suggesting that successful ecosystems can coexist, with each leveraging their unique strengths to serve users better. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the need for businesses to view open-source participation as an investment in long-term value creation rather than merely a cost.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Multicluster scheduling solutions, such as Armada and multiQ, address inefficiencies of traditional single-cluster systems by distributing workload across multiple clusters intelligently. These systems enable parallel processing, load balancing, and resource optimization while enforcing fairness through prioritization and rate limiting mechanisms.

Armada employs a plug-and-play architecture with the control plane (API server, scheduler, and UI component) communicating asynchronously with cluster executors. It uses Apache Pulsar for logging, PostgreSQL for history storage, and Radius for fast in-memory state management, ensuring responsiveness at high volumes. Armada supports fairness through preemption mechanisms, including urgency-based and fair-share preemption, as well as rate limiting and throttling to manage API or resource submissions during bursts.

multiQ, on the other hand, configures worker clusters from the management cluster and utilizes an admission check for intelligent workload placement. This admission check ensures that resources are reserved efficiently while preventing over-reservation issues by only marking jobs as suspended when no valid scheduling options exist. If an admission check fails due to a poorly designed system, it results in stuck job states; however, this shouldn&#x27;t lead to unnecessary resource reservations.

In summary, these multicluster scheduling solutions aim to enhance efficiency and scalability by intelligently distributing workloads across multiple Kubernetes clusters while maintaining fairness, load balance, and responsiveness.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses NRI (Node Resource Injector), a tool in Kubernetes that allows for hooking between Kubernetes and containers, enabling container mutation in place. Key points include:

1. NRI offers a powerful connection to Kubernetes and containers, facilitating feature enhancement beyond the standard offerings.
2. For Uber, it served as an essential solution to unblock specific challenges during migration, particularly for adding container logs.
3. NRI goes against Kubernetes&#x27; intended usage by making pods more mutable, introducing complexity and potential risks of breaking systems.
4. Implementation necessitates careful consideration due to added complexity, potential for breaking things if not managed properly, and the need for an exit strategy in case features are eventually upstream.
5. While NRI can be beneficial for specific use cases requiring unique or advanced features, organizations must weigh trade-offs and ensure that the added complexity is justified by their requirements.
6. The Uber team&#x27;s repo and blog post provide resources for those interested in learning more about implementing NRI or exploring similar engineering solutions.</div>

The decision was influenced by the need for continuous reconciliation and configuration-as-data capabilities at scale. Initially using Kubernetes Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) and operators, they chose Google Cloud Platform (GCP) over Amazon Web Services (AWS), believing in Google&#x27;s potential as an underdog. They now face challenges in allocating support requests to the correct teams and plan to implement tags in Backstage for better resource-specific support routing. The talk also touched upon their migration strategy, focusing on streamlining database transitions to cloud platforms like GCP with tools such as Crow and KCC.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discussed the optimization of Kubernetes for artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) workloads, focusing on network efficiency and user experience. The key challenges identified included:

1. DNS impacting AI/ML workloads due to their reliance on headless services and API servers. Traditional custom device plugins and CNI plugins led to inefficiencies and inconsistent performance.
2. The lack of portability for users tied to specific infrastructure, as they often employed custom solutions.
3. Complex internal topology problems across multiple nodes, with workloads distributed across various data centers.

To address these issues, the team improved Kubernetes:

1. Using Data Plane API (DPA) and Resource-Specific Scheduler to enhance scheduling mechanisms for accelerators like GPUs. This resulted in consistent zero variance on performance improvements compared to traditional methods.
2. Implementing a common language through DPA, enabling seamless interaction between different devices and network drivers, including NVIDIA&#x27;s DR GPU driver.
3. The upcoming Inference Gateway API extension aims to simplify exposing AI models for users while optimizing backend selection based on metrics like GPU utilization.

The ultimate goal is to provide a unified, efficient, and user-friendly experience across various hardware architectures and data center topologies.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">1. Dragonjet (DRA) is an open-source event stream processing platform designed for building changedriven architectures, simplifying data integration and reaction triggers across various systems without requiring large data migrations.
2. DRA consists of three components: sources, queries, and reactions. Sources ingest data from different systems like databases or message queues, query engines process the incoming data streams to detect changes, and reactions are actionable functions triggered upon change detection.
3. Sources are independent scale units, allowing for efficient scaling based on the volume of changes in each dataset. While not explicitly stated, DRA likely supports additional scaling methods like load balancing and autoscaling using cloud provider tools (e.g., Azure&#x27;s Identity Management, AWS IAM).
4. Queries maintain result sets in graph indexes, which can be persisted in various storage systems like RocksDB, Redis, or In-Memory stores, depending on the use case and production environment requirements.
5. DRA&#x27;s sources don&#x27;t necessarily need to support a change feed; they merely need an ingestion mechanism. If a source has built-in change feeds (e.g., Azure Cosmos DB), it integrates seamlessly with DRA. For systems without built-in change feeds, DRA provides mechanisms to derive changes using APIs like Kubernetes&#x27; watch API or versioning timestamps.
6. The system allows for reactions based on graph queries, providing a declarative way of defining business logic using intuitive graph queries. Custom SDKs and pre-built sources enable users to create their own sources and reactions.
7. DRA is designed to simplify complex event-driven architectures by enabling real-time data integration, reactions, and stream processing without requiring extensive custom code or large-scale data migrations. The platform aims to foster collaboration within the community by providing open-source tools and components.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The speaker emphasizes the shift from infinitely horizontal scaling to vertical slices of capacity, focusing on routing jobs to the right resources instead of over-provisioning and preemptively managing workloads. They discuss multicq, a concept where different teams submit jobs, which are then routed to clusters with appropriate capabilities based on their requirements (e.g., GPU-intensive tasks). The speaker highlights topology-aware scheduling as an evolving area in Kubernetes, noting that current solutions are limited and looking forward to more sophisticated integrations of Dynamic Resource Reservation (DRR) information for better performance, particularly for AI training and inference workloads. They also touch upon the importance of Q and multiq patterns, along with gateway API inference extension and VLM&#x27;s prefix-aware caching, in optimizing reserved capacity utilization. The talk concludes with a metaphor of a spiral staircase symbolizing progress from traditional on-premises infrastructure to leveraging diverse compute sources for burst capacity, including cloud services, on-prem data centers, and even spot/reservation markets.

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Miley Fu, representing Second State, discusses Rust&#x27;s role in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) development. Rust&#x27;s unique compiler strength provides a tight feedback loop for AI, ensuring verifiable correctness through structural programming. This feature is crucial for AGI as it enables efficient and safe code execution, offering advantages over languages like Python.

Fu explains how Rust-based infrastructure, such as Echoit—a voice AI agent—benefits from Rust&#x27;s memory safety, preventing bugs typically found in distributed systems. The server, built on Rust, orchestrates communication with various components (ASR, TTS, LLM), ensuring seamless data flow and reducing context token usage by directly connecting MCP servers to the LLM without storing intermediate results in the context window.

The Rascoder project showcases code mode MCP tools—generate and compile&amp;fix—which can automatically generate complete Rust source code from a description, then compile and fix any errors, resulting in a self-improving cycle for better long-term efficiency. This method enables agents to create complex software without extensive human intervention, ensuring reasonably high levels of correctness.

Fu concludes by inviting questions, confirming that while direct benchmarks haven&#x27;t been conducted yet, the approach is expected to significantly reduce context token usage, likely surpassing 70%. Attendees are encouraged to interact with the voice AI agent using a hardware device provided by Second State.</div>

The talk discusses autoscaling strategies using Keda (Kubernetes Event Driver Extension) and its integration with custom resource definitions, focusing on two scenarios: a chain of related services and independent services accessing a common database.
2. In the chain scenario, Keda can be used to create a scaling group that ensures all related services are scaled together efficiently, minimizing unused capacity and maximizing responsiveness. Conversely, independent services can scale separately using Keda, potentially leading to wasted resources but avoiding starvation.
3. The talk introduces the concept of extending VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler) with custom metrics, which is an edge case but beneficial for certain use cases where monitoring resource consumption beyond CPU and memory makes sense.
4. The speakers demonstrate how Keda can be used to patch custom resource definitions, enabling autoscaling for various resources, including non-standard ones like model serving inference services.
5. A discussion on the trade-offs of using front-end CPU as a scaling trigger for backend services is presented, emphasizing the benefits of independent scaling and the flexibility provided by Kubernetes Workload&#x27;s ratio and mathematical expression modifier features.
6. The talk also addresses challenges in autoscaling JVM-based applications, suggesting that exposing more JVM metrics directly can help Keda scale based on relevant indicators instead of memory consumption alone.

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Falco, an open-source eBPF-based intrusion detection and prevention system, is focusing on performance improvements and maintainability enhancements based on community insights. Key areas of discussion include:

1. Event Loop Optimization:
   - Current event loop filtering has limitations; exploring more efficient multi-threading or advanced kernel side filtering to reduce overhead for millions of events per second.
   - Replacing the traditional &#x27;proof scan&#x27; with eBPF iterators in both the event loop and kernel module for improved speed, especially on large core count machines.

2. Maintainability Improvements:
   - Legacy BPF probe usage is low; considering deprecation or refactoring it as a plug-in due to increased build time dependencies and minimal user adoption.
   - Assessing the necessity of the Juvisisor lipcap engine, as it&#x27;s underutilized, and exploring its potential deprecation or redesign as a source plug-in for feature parity among drivers.

The Falco team invites community feedback on these proposed changes through their Slack channels (cubernetes) and the CNCF falco dev list, as well as attending the Falco project kiosk (13A) at the solutions showcase to discuss in person.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">IBM presents a semantic routing system called VM Routing for production inference efficiency improvement. This system leverages Rust core for high-performance classification using an inference engine, with a go layer facilitating integration with external API gateways like Envoy or as a standalone intercept filter. The unique approach addresses three inefficiencies: 28% query repetition within short periods, 31% unnecessary complex reasoning steps, and unnecessarily routing to large models for simple tasks.

Key features include:
- Cost-aware semantic router that reduces model complexity and route choices based on task importance and performance overhead.
- Continuous batching for high throughput, especially with large models like Quarkus.
- Integration with various backend inference stacks via open-source protocols (e.g., gRPC).

Evaluation was performed using traces from production VM deployments, demonstrating potential efficiency gains in time to first token (TFD) reduction and overall user experience improvement. The team is actively working on supporting multi-turn conversation tracking for semantic hashing applications. Open contributions are welcomed via their GitHub repository, where details of other evaluation datasets like ARC CommonsenseQA, TAPAS, Half-Windup, and Truthful QA can be found.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">1. Experiment with various instrumentation approaches when dealing with diverse traces, not just standard HTTP calls. For long-running jobs and async processes, consider scheduling executions and linking them in a trace waterfall view for better understanding.

2. Recognize potential phantom spans that don&#x27;t align correctly in your tracing data and add instrumentation to resolve these discrepancies. This can become part of your software development lifecycle (SDLC).

3. Be cautious but also invest in sampling techniques, such as tail samplers or more efficient alternatives like eBay&#x27;s approach, to minimize memory overhead while still gaining valuable insights from your traces.

4. Engage with the observability community by attending receptions at Miller Union (booth 1450) and watching Erikson&#x27;s talk on NRI OCI hooks and early data plane migration for more specific insights.

5. If you&#x27;re passionate about observability, consider applying to work with the team, as they have openings for individuals excited about upstream and related topics.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">This presentation discusses a distributed AI architecture leveraging Kubernetes and local language models (LLMs) for adjudication, auditing, and payment processes in healthcare, with implications for other industries as well. The system positions LLMs closer to the data source (edge) for cost-efficiency, privacy, and compliance reasons. Key benefits include reduced inference costs, enhanced accuracy through distributed reasoning, and smarter workflows across various sectors. Data standardization is achieved using metadata encoding and tracing mechanisms without sharing raw Personal Health Information (PHI). The model&#x27;s decision tree determines when to employ large-scale cloud LLMs versus local or edge-based models based on cost and capability requirements.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">1. The presentation discusses scaling and optimizing Prometheus, a popular open-source monitoring system, by implementing custom solutions like an index store and sampling mechanisms for exemplars (metrics associated with specific events).
2. An index store, inspired by Google&#x27;s Monarch paper, is used to efficiently route queries to the appropriate Time Series Database (TSDB) servers containing relevant data based on query labels, avoiding unnecessary scatter gather operations.
3. Exemplar sampling is applied post-data ingestion in Prometheus&#x27; TSDB, focusing on capturing only essential information for efficient storage and querying while minimizing data overhead. This process is driven by both the Prometheus client and internal logic within the TSDB.
4. The custom query layer built around ClickHouse allows for near real-time data analysis, leveraging ClickHouse&#x27;s columnar storage engine and indexing capabilities for fast query processing across distributed clusters.
5. The system supports clustering with multiple smaller ClickHouse instances instead of a single large cluster, enhancing scalability and manageability.
6. The architecture enables service graph connectors (like Pantopics) to provide cross-service insights by emitting exemplars alongside trace data, improving the overall observability into distributed systems.
7. Although direct comparisons with other open-source Prometheus-based solutions (e.g., Cortex, Mime) have not been conducted, the speaker emphasizes the efficiency of their approach in handling large-scale data and minimizing resource consumption through intelligent routing and sampling techniques.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation focuses on recent developments and future plans for cryo, a content runtime within Kubernetes. Key points include:

1. In-place port vertical scaling, allowing updates to CPU and memory resources without restarting workloads like AI training jobs, supported via new CLI API introduced in 133.
2. Container stop signals enhancement, enabling customization of stop actions beyond just timeout, with cryo respecting the &#x27;stop signal&#x27; field for containers.
3. CI/CD integration for container and pod metrics, moving this functionality from Cublet to cryo itself to improve efficiency and reduce resource waste. This move aims to provide consistent metric collection across different runtime environments and accommodate non-container workloads like VMs.
4. OCI volume source addition in recent versions, enabling direct mounting of OCI objects (images or artifacts) as volumes within containers, improving interoperability with OCI registries and simplifying management of related files.
5. Future roadmap highlights include expanded support for OC artifacts such as signature verification and automatic extraction, enhanced security features like privilege container security audit and ongoing CNCF security audits, and performance testing in CI to ensure cryo&#x27;s efficiency at scale.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Kubernetes has introduced Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) as a feature, enabling more efficient resource utilization in clusters with varying hardware capabilities like CPUs and GPUs. The DRA is integrated into the standard upstream scheduler (cubeuler), starting from Kubernetes 134, allowing for guaranteed bandwidth allocation on secondary network interfaces within pods.

DRA supports various functionalities such as CPU driver, GPU resource allocation, consumable capacity, and intelligent scheduling using DRA. These features are currently in their alpha stage or preview mode, with the intention of becoming general availability (GA) soon. The team encourages users to explore the example driver available on GitHub, which serves as a foundation for developing custom DRA drivers by adhering to specific go interface requirements.

Regarding autoscaling, VPA (Vertical Pod Autoscaler) works seamlessly with DRA for in-place pod resizing. However, DRA integration into cluster autoscaler functionality is pending and expected to be available shortly after Kubernetes 135, with cloud vendors likely implementing support independently. It&#x27;s also worth noting that classic DRA has undergone design changes over the years to better align with cluster autoscaling requirements.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses the cluster network policy (CNP) architecture with a tiered approach for managing security and network policies across Kubernetes clusters. The tiers include admin, baseline, and network policies, each having distinct priorities defined by labels. The current system allows for passing traffic through tiers without explicit rules within a single tier, which is achieved using the &#x27;pass&#x27; action at the lowest tier level. 

The &#x27;pass&#x27; action signifies that the policy disposition (allow/deny) decision should be delegated to the next lower-tier policy based on priority. This mechanism enables expressiveness while maintaining simplicity and clarity in policy management, as it avoids complex rule combinations. 

There are ongoing discussions around extending this tiered system to support dynamic tiers with arbitrary labels for greater flexibility. Additionally, the potential use of &#x27;pass&#x27; as an action within a hierarchical governance structure could simplify policy organization across multiple teams, ensuring self-documenting and manageable policy sets.

The team is open to incorporating these suggestions for future iterations of the CNP system to better cater to diverse administrative needs and improve overall cluster policy management practices.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation explores three real-life case studies revealing how a single vulnerability in container technology impacted different cloud service providers (Azure, Replicate, Digital Ocean) with varying outcomes:

1. In Azure, the attacker could read sensitive data but was flagged by the blue team due to robust security measures.
2. On Replicate, an attacker gained lateral movement and access to sensitive data before being detected.
3. With Digital Ocean, a full service takeover occurred, exposing customers&#x27; cloud environments to the internet.

The talk emphasizes the importance of not relying on containers as the sole security barrier between different tenants or environments. Instead, multiple types of guardrails should be employed, including compute, virtualization, authentication, authorization, and more, ensuring separation is multi-layered. The research also highlights that a robust security posture can mitigate zero-day attacks, emphasizing principles like virtualization-based isolation, strong network rules, and credential hygiene.

Whiz Research plans an open source hacking competition called zeroday.cloud to spotlight vulnerabilities in crucial cloud projects, offering a $5 million reward for finding exploits and enhancing the safety of these open-source tools powering the cloud ecosystem.</div>

He highlights the differences between CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) and standalone extension API servers, focusing on use cases and production lessons learned.

Cubecape is a security platform that deals with container image vulnerability scanning, configuration scanning, and workload behavior monitoring, generating substantial data like ASBOMBs (lists of container image components). Initially, Cubecape utilized CRDs for their simplicity, but as they faced limitations such as size constraints and need for custom storage solutions, they opted to build an extension API server.

Malka explains the architecture of aggregated API servers within Kubernetes, featuring built-in types, Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs), and aggregated API servers in a chain for handling requests. He emphasizes that aggregation allows for more flexibility while controlling storage, validation logic, and behavior.

The process involves implementing an API server&#x27;s storage interface, disabling the watch API, and configuring API service objects for routing requests to appropriate services within the cluster. With this setup, clients can communicate with external APIs securely using CA bundles or TLS.

Key takeaways include:
1. CRDs are easy to implement and serve as a default choice, with Kubernetes handling heavy lifting.
2. Extension API servers become necessary when CRDs fall short of custom storage needs, data size limitations exist, or unique backends are required.
3. When embarking on this path, be prepared for the operational burden of managing critical infrastructure and potential risks like cluster impact from faulty operations or resource flooding.
4. Consider factors such as use cases, object complexity, and support for watch functionality when deciding whether to employ CRDs or standalone extension API servers.
5. Continually assess and refine your approach, as Malka&#x27;s team learned through experience that sometimes disregarding certain Kubernetes features might not be the best choice for performance optimization.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">EBP F (OBI) is a zero-code instrumentation alternative to traditional SDKs, offering visibility into platform and runtime internals, lower layers of network stacks, and traffic information for exotic protocols. Its primary limitation is requiring Linux with EPF capability and elevated privileges. Key use cases include working with uninstrumented frameworks or legacy platforms without existing SDK coverage. OBI can detect partially instrumented applications using custom spans/attributes from SDKs and merge data accordingly. While integration between eBPF and SDKs is ongoing, it&#x27;s not yet comprehensive. Performance impact on nodes varies but generally remains low (typically 2-3% CPU usage). It runs in the node for privilege access to process-level instrumentation. OBI can also function as a sidecar container, limiting monitoring to processes within a single pod, although this approach may be less efficient than running it as a daemonset across all nodes.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">This demonstration highlighted potential security vulnerabilities in Kubernetes clusters, focusing on network policy implementation and misuse of privileges, such as exploiting unrestricted access through CubeDNS for DNS enumeration. The talk emphasized the importance of robust network policies and Pod Security Admission (PSA) to mitigate these risks. It was suggested that admission webhooks and validating admission policies can further enhance security by enforcing business logic before resource creation.

Additionally, the presentation stressed the significance of diversity within tech communities, specifically mentioning various underrepresented groups initiatives like Mar Forward to support minority voices in Kubernetes development. The speakers addressed questions about the effectiveness of GitOps principles and continuous delivery for mitigating attacks, acknowledging that while they can enforce restrictions on privileged pod creation, they might not immediately respond to an ongoing attack.

The materials from this session will be made available on GitHub post-conference, offering demos and related commands for further learning.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation introduced the Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRRA) in Kubernetes, emphasizing its versatility beyond just GPUs for various resources. Key features include:

1. **Consumable Capacity**: This feature allows allocating specific portions of a resource like a GPU, ensuring that each application gets only what it needs, preventing over-allocation and optimizing resource usage.

2. **Request Policy Control**: Users can define request policies to control minimum, maximum, default, and block sizes for allocations using DRRA. This allows fine-grained control over how resources are shared among multiple applications.

3. **Partitionable Devices**: DRRA supports partitioned devices like GPUs with multiple MIGs (Multi-Instance Graphics), enabling allocation of specific subsets or portions of these devices as needed.

4. **Accountability and Optimization**: Resource consumption is handled by the scheduler, which enforces constraints set by the driver. Accounting ensures that allocations align with actual usage to prevent over-provisioning.

5. **Preemption Potential**: Though currently not implemented in DRRA, there&#x27;s potential for advanced scheduling features where a vendor could signal priority changes or additional allocation needs to the scheduler, potentially optimizing resource allocation dynamically.

The demo showcased how DRRA facilitated sharing of GPU resources with different demands, ensuring each application received appropriate portions without conflicts, while also highlighting the ability to optimize resource utilization and prevent over-provisioning.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The Kubernetes Data Protection Working Group, co-chaired by Shing Yang from VML/Borza and featuring insights from an unknown expert, is addressing challenges in ensuring data integrity within the Kubernetes ecosystem. The group emphasizes the importance of considering various consistency strategies during backup and restore processes due to the dynamic nature of Kubernetes operators modifying running applications&#x27; state.

Key takeaways include:
1. Multiple consistency strategies like crash consistent, snapshot-based (without impact on execution), fully consistent, and application-consistent backups are discussed, each with varying levels of impact on performance and data integrity.
2. The unique challenge posed by Kubernetes operators, which modify running applications, requires further development of options to pause or query them during backup processes to maintain consistency.
3. On restore, the order in which resources are restored becomes crucial, especially when operators are involved. A bottom-up approach, restoring volumes first and then dependent stateful sets, followed by operators, is suggested for optimal results.
4. The group invites audience participation through regular meetings (every two weeks on Wednesdays at 9:00 AM) and mailing lists/Slack channels to collaborate and refine data protection solutions in Kubernetes.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">gRPC, developed by Google, offers several advantages over traditional protocols:

1. **Efficiency and Performance**: Protobuf (the underlying technology for gRPC) is a binary format, making it more compact and faster than text-based formats like JSON or XML, thus improving performance and reducing overhead.

2. **Strongly Typed Contracts**: Protobuf&#x27;s schema defines the data structure of messages, ensuring strong type safety at compile-time, which reduces runtime errors and improves code maintainability.

3. **Versioning and Deprecation**: gRPC supports versioning through its unique numbering system and deprecation mechanism, allowing seamless evolution of APIs without breaking compatibility or causing downtime for consumers.

4. **Code Generation**: Tools like `protoc` generate client and server stubs in various languages, simplifying development and reducing manual coding efforts across language boundaries.

5. **Interoperability**: gRPC&#x27;s use of HTTP/2 enables bidirectional communication, making it compatible with existing infrastructure and supporting cross-language clients and servers.

6. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: Built-in features in gRPC enable efficient service discovery (using Kubernetes services or equivalent) and load balancing, simplifying distributed system management.

7. **Security**: gRPC supports Transport Layer Security (TLS), allowing secure communication over the network.

8. **RPC for Monolith Breakup**: gRPC can serve as a unified RPC layer between microservices within a monolith, promoting better structure and maintainability of complex systems without full refactoring.

9. **Unified Messaging System**: Introducing Protobuf as the messaging system facilitates consistent data format across an organization, easing integration with external systems or future split into independent services.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses securing open source supply chains using Salsa, a GitHub-driven code review and approval system, and Notary for container image signing. The process begins with developers building their source code into images or Helm charts, signed using Cosign, and then scanned for vulnerabilities with tools like Snyk, Trivy, or Grape. Salsa Source Track is employed to generate provenance attestations, including verification ID and resource URL, signed by Notary.

These attestations are attached to the images via ORAS before deployment into a Kubernetes cluster. Gatekeeper, in conjunction with Ratify as an external data provider, enforces these policies during admission control, ensuring only verified images are deployed. The Salsa Verify plugin is implemented using custom policies defined in Kubernetes&#x27; Admission Controller, verifying aspects like the signing level and resource URL against predefined rules.

A live demo showcases this workflow with a BYO agent image deployment:
1. A lightweight Kubernetes cluster is set up alongside Caper (an AI workflow platform) and Ratify.
2. A Ratify constraint is configured to enforce Salsa level checking for commit actions on the main branch and tags.
3. A Salsa action runs on commits merged into the main branch, verifying the SALSA level and generating a signed attestation (VSA).
4. The demonstrated image complies with SALSA level 2 initially; after updating to level 3, the agent image is redeployed, adhering to the new policy requirements.
5. The process is validated through Caper UI, logs, and Kubernetes&#x27; admission control logs, ensuring only trusted images are deployed in the cluster.

Useful links for further exploration include a quick start guide available in the project&#x27;s demo repository. A follow-up session at the project booth from 4 PM to 7 PM provides an opportunity to discuss signing and verification strategies more deeply with the speakers.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Marcelo Costa, head of data at Mechanu Bank in Brazil, presents an automated data streaming solution using Kafka and related technologies. Previously, Mechanu Bank faced challenges in providing real-time access to data across its on-premises systems, including a mainframe, leading to lengthy data transfer processes (up to seven business days). This inefficiency slowed decision-making for business leaders.

To address these issues, Mechanu Bank developed an integration hub—a data architecture grounded in Kafka—capable of connecting disparate systems and managing data flow efficiently. The architectural design consisted of nine core technologies working harmoniously, including a robust DevOps pipeline, Kubernetes for container orchestration, and Argo CD (Automatic Repository Crawler) for declarative configuration management and automation of Kafka Connect.

The integration hub featured a streamlined process for creating connectors that moved data between systems like mainframes, Salesforce CRM, or Oracle ERP. Developers would craft the logic in a single programming language, package it into an YOML file, and push it to the Git repository (Azure). The Argo CD would detect the new configuration and initiate reconciliation, automatically constructing Kafka Connect resources based on the defined parameters.

The platform&#x27;s custom resource operator monitored the target Kafka Connect port, creating the actual connector and optimizing load distribution by assigning pods with fewer existing connectors to the new one. This automation drastically reduced lead times from days or weeks to just four hours per connector.

Adopting this automation strategy transformed Mechanu Bank&#x27;s operations:

- Eliminated manual creation processes prone to human errors and bottlenecks
- Enhanced control, reliability, and scalability in data transfer
- Fostered a collaborative environment between development, operations, and business teams
- Sleekly transitioned 3,000 tables from the old system to the new one with no incidents
- Demonstrated that Kafka, when combined with appropriate tools, automation, and strategic alignment, can become a fast, reliable ally for data needs

In summary, Marcelo Costa&#x27;s talk illustrates how Mechanu Bank harnessed automation using Kafka, Argo CD, and Kubernetes to revolutionize its data streaming architecture, improving efficiency, reliability, and collaboration across various teams.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">1. For higher-order Kubernetes provisioning, a controller isn&#x27;t always necessary, as templating logic (e.g., Helm, Flux) can suffice. In certain use cases, a container-based login system, like CoreWeave, is more suitable due to its lighter weight compared to full VMs and seamless integration with existing Kubernetes clusters.
2. Container orchestration handles node failures primarily through Kubernetes&#x27; life cycle management and node controllers, while workload scheduling (Slurm) manages node drainage as slurm drains. The highest layer involves defining strategies for checkpointing jobs based on the cloud provider&#x27;s controller.
3. CoreWeave manages services and performance by scaling resources as clusters grow and utilizing Prometheus for monitoring. Automatic detection of service failures or resource performance issues is achieved through these tools, with additional assistance from specialized teams for complex scenarios.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Hiroshi Hayakawa, a product owner at LY Corporation, emphasizes the importance of maximizing application launch reliability on Kubernetes for stable operation in production environments. He categorizes issues into startup failures due to low performance or unpredictable causes like slight performance degradation from minor code changes or library updates.

Hayakawa introduces two tuning strategies: container-level and application-level. Container-level tuning involves adjusting resource allocation (CPU, memory) in Kubernetes manifests using request and limit settings. He advocates for setting high limits for containers during startup to compensate for performance disadvantages. Application-level tuning focuses on optimizing runtime parameters, JVM memory management in Java applications, and considering cgroups&#x27; impact on language runtimes.

He stresses the necessity of ensuring applications are fully initialized before serving traffic, highlighting post-startup life cycle hooks or readiness probes for proper initialization. Examples include adjusting database connection pool sizes or thread pool limits to optimize resource usage during startup.

The presentation delves into a new Kubernetes feature called &quot;impress port resize,&quot; which allows resizing container resources without restarting containers. This can help overcome low performance immediately after launch by allocating more resources until the application stabilizes and then reducing them to appropriate values once stability is achieved. Hayakawa mentions considering this approach for improving launch reliability but acknowledges potential risks, such as memory limit reduction triggering container termination, especially for Java applications that may struggle with dynamic cgroups changes.

The speaker also highlights the need for careful consideration and automation when implementing impress port resize in production due to varying resource consumption patterns between startup and normal load fluctuations. Hayakawa suggests exploring dedicated autoscale options tailored for reducing resources only after startup, emphasizing separate conditions for triggering scaling based on application needs.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Yuxing Yuan and Hao Wu introduce Open Cruise, a CNCF incubating project focused on application automation with features like in-place updates and set management. They highlight a key capability called Syscas for zero-downtime configuration updates. This tool decouples sidecar container lifecycle from the main application containers, enabling seamless configuration rollouts without service interruptions.

Syscas uses admission webhooks to inject set containers into selected ports during updates, supporting in-place image updates, volume mountings, and life cycle management for stateful sidecars like monitoring agents or collectors. This allows independent management of these tools from main applications, making configuration changes more manageable.

The speakers discuss real-world incidents illustrating the importance of advanced configuration delivery, such as AWS&#x27;s July 2024 outage and Google Cloud&#x27;s June 2025 seven-hour downtime caused by misconfiguration issues. They emphasize that existing methods for configuration updates are manual, risky, and non-progressive, prompting the need for more sophisticated solutions like Open Cruise&#x27;s Config Map Set.

Config Map Set is a declarative custom resource definition (CRD) that offers several benefits over current practices:

1. Declarative CRD: A new resource type called Config Map Set is introduced, allowing users to define human-readable aliases for configuration versions and specify actual configuration details in the data field.
2. Versioned Configuration: When a new Config Map Set or CMS is created, an Open Cruise webhook automatically generates a separate Config Map (CMS hub) that stores historical configuration versions. The revision history limit controls how many past revisions are retained, ensuring traceability of each configuration update.
3. Progressive Roll Out: Users can define roll-out policies by percentage or absolute number of instances, enabling safe and controlled updates instead of full restarts.
4. Decoupled from Image Versions: Config Map Set independence from image versions means that image versions do not affect the selection strategy when CMS updates pod configurations.
5. Pod Synchronization: The CMS controller manages revisions by writing the latest configuration version into the CMS hub, synchronizing pods with desired target configuration versions using reload sidecars and restarting injected containers if necessary.

The speakers demonstrate various real-world use cases for Config Map Set, including progressive configuration updates, multi-version validation, gradual dependency migration, and AI/risk control systems. They also discuss upcoming enhancements like multi-version management, proportional scaling support, cross-cluster version control, and the goal of making configuration delivery as safe, intelligent, and automated as application deployment itself.

The presentation emphasizes that Config Map Set is now available as part of Open Cruise&#x27;s new version and invites viewers to learn more about the project on opencruise.io, provide feedback via communication channels like snakewatch or dingtalk, and consider contributing code, documentation, or sharing use cases. The speakers conclude by hinting at the potential future opportunity of implementing a comprehensive package version management tool for Yam packages or driver versions, similar to the declarative approach used for configuration management.</div>

This setup ensures data mirroring for both single volumes and consistency groups between two or more clusters, facilitating application protection in active-active configurations.

Key aspects of the DR solution include:

1. Utilizing open cluster management for application lifecycle management and cluster management
2. Multicluster Operator orchestrates failover and failback processes
3. RBD mirroring daemon handles data replication between clusters, maintaining both directions
4. Volume Replication Class (CRD) and Volume Replication CR manage the replication process for individual volumes or consistency groups
5. Ability to perform asynchronous and synchronous replication, affecting data loss based on user-defined recovery point objective (RPO)
6. Managed applications (declarative via GitOps tools like ArgoCD) and discovered applications (all resources backed up in object storage by Rook) can be protected differently
7. Testing environment using mini CUBE for validating DR setups, alongside ramen ctl tool for cluster validation and application deployment

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The key points of the talk revolve around a robust Kubernetes upgrade strategy, incorporating emulation for backward compatibility. The process involves using an emulator flag to enable emulation of older versions (133) during the initial upgrade phase (134), followed by clearing the emulator flag to complete the full API and compatibility upgrade.

This method ensures that components can operate seamlessly with both old and new APIs, minimizing disruptions. The team emphasizes comprehensive testing for drivers, add-ons, and other elements across various configurations using automated frameworks.

Testing includes synthetic tests that invoke pods to run functional checks, allowing the pipeline to pass or fail based on test conditions. Rollbacks are managed at the control plane level, ensuring clusterwide rollbacks in case of issues during upgrades.

The emulation technique, while initially developed by the open-source community, is adopted and customized for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). Although full emulator version support isn&#x27;t currently available in open source, there are plans to extend this capability. Rollbacks cover only control plane versions, not individual nodes.

In summary, the key takeaways include:
1. A well-structured upgrade process with backward compatibility using emulation.
2. Rigorous testing for various components and configurations.
3. Automated framework integration and synthetic test execution.
4. Rollback capability at the control plane level, ensuring clusterwide stability.
5. Planned extension of emulator version support to open-source communities.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presented discussion focuses on Kubernetes AI workload optimization, specifically addressing statefulness in AI workloads and traditional routing limitations. LLMD (Large Language Model Deployment) aims to make Kubernetes AI-aware by implementing techniques such as:

1. Approximate caching: Sends prompts to the current replica location, minimizing queuing issues.
2. Precise caching: Directs prompts to the exact KV cache location where the state for generating subsequent tokens resides.
3. KV offloading: Enables extending GPU memory with CPU or persistent storage for larger datasets.
4. Cache management: Plans to introduce more sophisticated LRU and cost-aware cache management algorithms, like granular explicit KV cache control.
5. Predictive decode length estimation: To better handle variable token generation in decoding processes.
6. Autoscaling: Early development for scaling resources based on demand.
7. Load balancing with distributed caches: Prioritizes factors beyond just prefix cache hits for effective load distribution across multiple instances.

The key takeaway is that LLMD enhances Kubernetes AI deployment by addressing statefulness, improving routing techniques, and introducing advanced caching management strategies for better resource utilization and performance optimization.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses strategies for gradual deployment of software updates, focusing on two primary methods: geographical rolling and percentage-based rollouts. 

1. Geographical Rollout: This involves deploying updates in stages across different regions or locations. The talk emphasizes the importance of monitoring these updates closely to ensure smooth transitions and minimal disruption. For developers, it&#x27;s crucial to have visibility into the deployment status at various geographical levels to manage expectations effectively. 

2. Percentage-based Rollout: In this method, updates are rolled out incrementally, with specific segments of users or systems updated at predetermined intervals (e.g., 10%, 20%, etc.). This approach provides more control over the release process and allows for quicker rollbacks if issues arise. The talk highlights the need for robust monitoring during these phases to maintain system health, user experience, and identify potential bottlenecks early.

Additional considerations include implementing proper roll-back mechanisms beforehand, understanding coupling effects among changes (when various components are interdependent), and ensuring backward compatibility to avoid unexpected issues upon deploying independent changes. The talk also touches on the importance of timing for gradual rollouts, suggesting it varies based on factors such as deployment frequency and system complexity.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses an advanced networking solution for Cubeword, utilizing Netkit and AFXTP for improved performance with reduced latency and increased throughput. Key points include:

1. Current setup requires specifying &#x27;data_path_mode=netkit&#x27; in Cubeword configuration to enable this feature, although future plans involve automatic detection if the underlying kernel supports it.
2. The current system leverages BPF for handling TCP and may support big TCP in the near future, depending on AFXTP device capabilities.
3. For network address translation (masquerading), selium intends to utilize similar functionality as it has with XTP, once an AFXTP transmit side hook is implemented.
4. Jumbo frames are supported by some AFXTP devices, allowing for larger packet handling. This feature depends on the AFXTP&#x27;s available RXTXQ pairs and can be managed through BPF programming.
5. Multiple interfaces within a single VM can work with this setup, as multiple Q bindings can expose different interfaces into VMs via the same mechanism.
6. The presentation emphasizes that future enhancements may include more granular control over network interface binding in Cubeword manifests or definitions through annotations.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The speakers, Ana Maria Lopez Moreno and Sharon Camacho, present an approach to creating multi-agent AI systems that can collaborate across different cloud platforms. They address the challenge of isolating AI agents within monolithic architectures, which limits scalability and context sharing. The proposed solution involves a centralized orchestrator that uses agent-to-agent (A2AP) protocols and model/context protocols to interact with various agents spread across GCP, AWS, or other clouds.

The architecture consists of an orchestrator (using Kubernetes), along with different agents – some in Azure and others potentially in GCP or other platforms. A2AP protocol facilitates communication between specific agents for tailored responses, while MCP (Model/Context Protocol) allows agents to share tools, acting like a marketplace for agents to pick necessary resources. Containers enhance scalability by enabling agents to adjust resource allocation based on task demands.

The demonstration highlights a multi-agent system repository built with Azure Kubernetes Services and the Microsoft agent framework, focusing on integrating diverse agents—marketing, financial, currency, planning, travel—from disparate cloud environments using A2AP and MCP protocols. The orchestrator communicates with these agents using their respective skill sets outlined in their agent cards, enabling it to direct requests to the most suitable agents for contextual responses.

The demo showcases a simple user interface that displays agents identified by the orchestrator, alongside functionalities like submitting tasks and monitoring cluster/APS performance. Challenges addressed include standardizing A2AP protocols across GCP and Microsoft environments, as well as managing agent endpoints and life cycle processes for robust, generative AI operations.

In essence, this approach emphasizes the creation of collaborative, multi-agent systems that overcome isolation issues and leverage diverse cloud platforms, all while maintaining scalability, efficiency, and adaptability through containerization and strategic communication protocols.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation introduces an AI-driven approach to streamline deploying machine learning models using Helm charts and Kubernetes for production scale. The method leverages existing Kubernetes APIs, like Leader Elected Workflow Scheduler (LWS) or Cluster Autoscaler, for automatic scaling. This system automatically generates necessary YAML files with Helm values, eliminating the need for manual specification of various configurations. The solution is flexible, allowing for a wide range of model deployments by adjusting input parameters and values files. Although it shares similarities to spec-driven development methods like Claire or Kale, this approach maintains a more open-ended definition of the deployment process. The system has been tested with an automated agent, but theoretical scalability benefits of using battle-tested Kubernetes APIs are inherent due to LWS&#x27;s design.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Dapper, a tool for building resilient applications, abstracts away common tasks like retries and circuit breakers, simplifying their implementation while ensuring robustness. It&#x27;s compatible with various languages (Java, .NET, Go, TypeScript) through dedicated SDKs and test containers modules. Dapper integrates seamlessly with other tools like Micro, a lightweight simulation tool, to further enhance application reliability without introducing significant overhead.

Micro, in turn, allows developers to manage multiple dependencies efficiently by simulating complex systems (Kafka, databases, etc.) locally, avoiding the need for full setups and resource-intensive environments. It also supports contract testing, ensuring applications adhere to specified APIs and contracts through built-in validation against open API schemas.

The talk emphasized Dapper workflows, implementing the durable execution pattern for long-running processes that can resume from a known good state across different machines or cloud providers. This is achieved using code instead of YAML or JSON configurations, aligning with Microsoft&#x27;s Durable Functions approach.

Additionally, an AI integration example demonstrated how Dapper and Micro could work together to create an automated order process for pizza delivery using a mocked AI service via YAML configuration files. The combination of these tools streamlines application development while maintaining reliability and resilience.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation introduces an AI system, MCP (Managed Capabilities Platform), designed to streamline Kubernetes cluster management by automating tasks based on company policies and best practices. Key features include:

1. **Automated Recommendations:** MCP retrieves information from various sources like documentation, wikis, Slack, and API endpoints, learning and applying company-specific rules for resource creation, schema retrieval, and embedding processes.
2. **Agent Orchestration:** The AI agent works alongside a connected orchestrator within MCP, ensuring read-only behavior while allowing code execution in the cluster.
3. **Dynamic Updates:** The system can be set up to periodically scan and update embedded data, such as API endpoints, based on changes detected in source systems.
4. **Nondeterministic Handling:** Unlike deterministic tasks, AI excels at handling nondeterministic processes, making it ideal for AI-driven recommendations that might vary depending on context or interpretation.
5. **Avoid Overspecification:** Companies should provide detailed yet not overly specific instructions to ensure the system can adapt and learn from a range of scenarios without needing constant manual updates.
6. **Maintaining Base Quality:** With nondeterministic AI processes, it&#x27;s essential to have robust testing and validation procedures in place to catch any potential issues before deployment. However, the talk emphasizes that the deterministic execution of scripts remains the responsibility of users, where AI and intelligent systems don&#x27;t replace human vigilance but rather support and augment workflows.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation demonstrates setting up a development environment with Backstage, a Kubernetes-native tool for developing connected ecosystems of APIs, data services, and microservices. The environment includes Argo CD, Chyore Manager, Ingress Engine X, and Crossplane configurations for seamless workflow management.

First, the speaker outlines installing necessary components within a Kind cluster using an initial setup script provided in the Backstack organization&#x27;s repository. This configuration enables developers to access a ready-to-use Backstage instance without manual installation.

The presentation then shifts focus to the user experience, starting with exploring the catalog for available resources: composite apps (e.g., my app), clustered applications (clustered app or web app), and more. The catalog showcases details about resources, such as their name spaces, target clusters, synced/ready status, and managed cross-plane resources.

Next, the speaker walks through creating a new service using the app template in Backstage. Users can specify an application name (e.g., demo app01) and its namespace (backstack demo), as well as select the resource owner. The process involves following the provided guide to create a new application, with templates for various services.

The talk emphasizes the benefits of having a unified interface for managing diverse resources within an organization&#x27;s ecosystem using Backstage. It also highlights how platform engineers can extend this developer experience and integrate it into their workflows.</div>

2. GitOps practices should extend observability, including versioning dashboards and alerts, treating observability as code.
3. Consistent labeling across traces, metrics, and dashboards enables correlation, aiding in identifying issues swiftly.
4. Implementing external link annotations in Argo CD can match resources to their associated Grafana dashboards for better visualization.
5. Crossplane users often encounter challenges such as inconsistent state, lack of explicit events, and the need for event-driven analysis.
6. Exemplars generated automatically by open-telemetry&#x27;s span metrics connector in Hotlog help tie traces with Prometheus metrics using trace IDs, enhancing observability.
7. The philosophy behind exemplar implementation is selecting relevant dimensions, like resource types and claim/composite parentage, for consistent correlation across aggregations.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In this discussion, a team shares their experience migrating from Linkerd to Istio (STout) and EnvoyGateway for service mesh management in their system handling 1 billion transactions daily in both northbound and mesh directions. Key takeaways include:

1. Planning was crucial, encompassing pre-migration testing, execution, and post-migration optimization, including observability enhancements with Prometheus and Grafana dashboards.
2. The migration process involved disabling mutual TLS for safe traffic between STout and Linkerd during the transition phase.
3. A unified HTTP route (HCP Router) was utilized to manage both northbound and east-west traffic, simplifying the migration.
4. Canary deployments within existing Kennedy rollout processes ensured no double deployment; flagger canaries scaled proportionally with traffic distribution.
5. The average canary bootstrap time was 10 minutes, requiring minimal duplication of resources for a short period.
6. Continuous improvement and addressing reliability issues post-migration were essential aspects of the team&#x27;s approach.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">1. The transition from Haroxy to Envoy Gateway was facilitated by evaluating feature sets and using Envoy&#x27;s Envoy patch policy for custom configuration adjustments, unlike native CNI gateways which may not expose all necessary knobs.
2. Enhanced load balancing capabilities, such as Orca or Open Request Cost Aggregation, can be implemented with Envoy Gateway through custom metrics from backends to optimize traffic routing.
3. Sizing of Envoy Proxy depends on configuration, including connection pool size and number of threads for handling connections and request processing latency. A 192-core node was mentioned to manage around 30k connections per second with a P50 response time under five milliseconds.
4. Additional tuning for buffer sizes and overload managers was not required in Envoy Gateway, as the architecture allowed for overprovisioning to handle sudden traffic spikes without concern.
5. The migration from Haroxy to Envoy Gateway involved running both side-by-side initially or migrating clients individually to avoid disruption, with both sharing the same backends since Envoy has direct awareness of those upstreams through BGP anycast routing.
6. A multi-gateway setup was employed for core services requiring dedicated Envoy pods and a single shared gateway for less critical internal services using host name headers. Users can also deploy custom gateways for specific needs like session persistence.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses Kubernetes storage integration, emphasizing the role of CSI (Container Storage Interface) as a standard for decoupling Kubernetes from vendor-specific storage quirks through gRPC. Key capabilities include dynamic provisioning, snapshots, and clones. When comparing CSI drivers, consider strategic platform refreshes like migrating to CubeVert, ensuring vendors support desired features, and validating performance post-testing.

Important future developments mentioned include the integration of Multi-Volume Management (MVME) over fabrics, replication extensions for multicluster disaster recovery (DR), and change block tracking (CBT). CBT will enable incremental backups by supporting change proc tracking at the CSI driver level, with vendors implementing this feature separately.

In summary, CSI is a crucial backbone for Kubernetes storage agility across container and cube VM workloads, with ongoing advancements in integration capabilities, replication, and backup efficiency.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In this demonstration, the importance of Test-Driven Development (TDD) for platform engineering is highlighted using CrossPlane as an example. The speakers illustrate a scenario where a wrong secret name in the CI pipeline led to a failed test, which prevented merging the PR initially. By implementing TDD with Chainsaw, a declarative testing tool, they ensured tests run locally and on the platform&#x27;s CI system before deployment. This process validated the correct secret creation and subsequently merged the PR. The demonstration showcases how TDD can benefit both development and platform teams by enhancing testability, fostering collaboration, and increasing confidence in deployments. The speakers emphasize that Chainsaw&#x27;s simplicity allows non-programmers to write tests without needing complex coding skills, promoting a cohesive environment for both teams.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses Kubernetes Policy Management using KubeArmor, focusing on five primary policy types: Generate, Validate, Mutation, Audit, and Override. Key use cases include cost management, best practices enforcement, request/limit setting, dangling resource cleanup, and stale deployment identification.

1. Cost Management: Implement Cleanup policies to remove unused PVCs, volumes, or idle pods, reducing costs. Monitor the impact of these policies on cluster spending using tools like AWS Cost Explorer or similar observability platforms.

2. Best Practices: Enforce labeling conventions and request/limit settings through Validate policies to ensure consistent resource management across applications. Address gaps by automatically adding missing labels or limits, reducing human error.

3. Resource Allocation: Set Request and Limit values using Deployment configurations, with Validate policies enforcing the desired limits. Monitor developer behavior by creating reports for invalid Deployments, and use Audit mode to softly block non-compliant Deployments without interrupting workflows.

4. Dangling Resources Detection: Leverage KubeArmor&#x27;s PVC state checks to identify unbound Persistent Volumes (PVCs), indicating unused resources. Similarly, Monitor idle pods using custom logic or query external APIs for application traffic information to proactively scale deployments up or down based on demand.

5. Stale Deployments Identification: Utilize Mutation policies to automatically update, delete, or reconfigure Deployments based on predefined conditions, ensuring applications remain optimized and aligned with resource needs.

In summary, KubeArmor offers a robust policy management system for Kubernetes, supporting various use cases such as cost optimization, enforcing best practices, resource allocation, dangling resource cleanup, and stale deployment identification. By implementing appropriate policies tailored to specific requirements, organizations can maintain efficient, secure, and cost-effective Kubernetes environments.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation discusses Agent Gateway, a purpose-built data plane solution designed with several key optimizations based on Envoy&#x27;s experiences:

1. Simplified internal representation for efficient updates: Agent Gateway separates resources like routes and listeners into standalone entities that can be updated independently, reducing the need to push large chunks of data during configuration changes. This approach contrasts with Envoy&#x27;s more complex structure, which leads to higher computational overhead when updating resources.

2. Native building: By constructing all necessary functionalities within a single proxy, Agent Gateway minimizes inter-process communication, leading to improved performance and simplified management. This approach also reduces the complexity of debugging and monitoring distributed systems.

3. Scalability and efficiency for specific patterns: Agent Gateway recognizes common user patterns such as scaling pods and services frequently and optimizes its internal data structures accordingly. For instance, it minimizes memory and CPU usage on the control plane during scale-up/scale-down events compared to Envoy&#x27;s approach.

4. Openness and open governance: The Agent Gateway project is an open-source effort, donated to the Linux Foundation, allowing for community involvement and ensuring transparency. This philosophy aligns with current trends favoring open data plane solutions over closed alternatives.

5. Performance comparisons: In benchmark tests against Envoy&#x27;s AI gateway (which employs external processors), Agent Gateway demonstrated significant improvements in throughput for LLM (Language Modeling) traffic, sometimes up to 100x and occasionally as high as 10x, due to reduced inter-process communication overhead.

6. Emphasis on the Agent Gateway API benchmark: The presentation highlights performance numbers from this benchmark that compares various gateways based on route scale, throughput, and other tests, providing a comprehensive understanding of Agent Gateway&#x27;s advantages over existing solutions.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The talk introduces a simulation testing framework, &quot;Camera,&quot; designed for verifying controller behaviors within Kubernetes clusters. Camera&#x27;s core feature is model checking, enabling deterministic convergence testing by exploring a vast state space without needing actual API server interaction or container spin-up times typically required in traditional testing. This allows for rapid evaluation of cluster states and property verification across numerous scenarios.

The tool reimplements Kubernetes controllers to simulate their behavior thoroughly. While it&#x27;s intended as a replacement for conventional controller runtime tests, its DFS-based approach offers deeper property analysis than typical end-to-end test suites like those provided by CubeBuilder. Although the talk didn&#x27;t explicitly detail migration steps from existing frameworks such as controller runtime and Jingo to Camera, it&#x27;s suggested that properties expressed in terms of cluster state could be translated easily.

The primary motivation for not running a small cluster directly was to leverage the opportunity to replace the API client with a simulated one, thus enabling more advanced model checking techniques. The speaker also saw potential value in using tools like Hoverfly for observing and replaying controller-API interactions, helping to fill in simulation data or even stub controller behaviors without access to their source code. Overall, Camera aims to provide robust property verification for Kubernetes controllers while addressing the challenges of state space exploration and minimizing container spin-up times.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">This presentation discusses implementing an open telemetry system to manage and analyze data across various layers of a multi-layered infrastructure, primarily focusing on a government institution&#x27;s self-managed Brazilian data center. The key aspects include:

1. Utilizing Apache Kafka for buffering telemetry data between lower layers (SNMP collectors) and higher ones (e.g., Kubernetes clusters). The number of Kafka partitions is tailored to the environment&#x27;s broker count, optimizing resource utilization.
2. Emphasizing unified identities for infrastructure configuration items across different abstraction layers, simplifying correlation between resources.
3. Leveraging off-the-shelf open source components and custom exporters where necessary, with some manual work required due to unique data formats from various hardware providers.
4. Expanding the telemetry approach beyond application-layer data to encompass environmental factors like power and cooling (PDU/branch circuits) for comprehensive data collection in a multi-layered infrastructure.
5. Advising on managing ingress costs for log data, particularly when moving to AWS or similar services: understand what&#x27;s crucial for your use case and employ cost-effective storage solutions accordingly; consider using tools like Otel Collector (formerly Jaeger) to gain insights into telemetry signals for automated filtering and routing.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The video discusses transitioning from a monolithic infrastructure to a Kubernetes-based cell architecture, designed with people in mind. This cell architecture divides an organization into independent domains (cells), each responsible for specific business functions, simplifying team management and ownership. Each cell encapsulates its data and logic, exposing only necessary APIs through a gateway, enhancing security and scalability.

Key benefits include:
1. Clear separation of concerns between teams and domains
2. Improved service discovery, autoscaling, versioning, and log management
3. Separation of tech and business logs for easier monitoring
4. Enabling AI integration within the enterprise by packaging AI models as cells, ensuring compliance with governance and data policies

The speakers have contributed to this concept through a specification document (available on markdown) and a reference implementation called OpenCoro, an open-source platform that facilitates cell architecture development and deployment. They encourage interested parties to explore the provided URLs for more information and offer demos or Q&amp;A sessions upon request.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The talk emphasizes that embracing multicloud strategies doesn&#x27;t necessarily equate to increased portability, efficiency, or reduced vendor lock-in. Instead, it often leads to complexities and higher operational costs. Key points include:

1. Multicloud setups don&#x27;t inherently offer true portability; teams end up replicating their expertise across different cloud platforms instead of optimizing for efficiency.
2. The belief that Kubernetes ensures unrestricted cloud migration is a misconception, as teams often find themselves managing various database failovers and infrastructure troubleshooting tasks at odd hours, regardless of the cloud provider.
3. Focusing on optimizing for sleep rather than portability can save resources and prevent engineer burnout. Preparing for the real disaster – the loss of valuable talent due to inefficient workflows – is crucial.
4. The misguided notion that abstraction leads to freedom often results in teams becoming overly reliant on managed services without a clear understanding of their limitations or costs.
5. Total cost of ownership (TCO) discussions frequently overlook the opportunity cost of engineer expertise and empathy, which are vital investments for any organization.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation emphasizes the importance of good telemetry, focusing on the OpenTelemetry project&#x27;s instrumentation score as a tool for defining and enforcing best practices. Key points include:

1. Instrumentation Score: A baseline for evaluating telemetry quality, with rules to identify good and bad practices. It&#x27;s open for community contribution through GitHub or CNCF Slack channels.
2. Semantics Conventions: Essential for clear and consistent telemetry description across various systems, ensuring uniformity in identifying signals (e.g., HTTP attributes). However, some conventions are complex due to the vast range of technologies needing description.
3. Practical Challenges: Automated instrumentation agents may not always capture all necessary details automatically, like thread IDs or host IPs and MAC addresses. This highlights the need for clear opinions on which data points should be captured by default.
4. Feedback Mechanism: The talk stresses that strong opinions on semantic conventions should ideally be consolidated in a separate project like instrumentation score to provide structured feedback for continuous improvement of these conventions.
5. Influence and Evolution: While some semantic conventions originate from OpenTracing, the Elastic Common Schema, or similar sources, their evolution may outpace the pace at which they&#x27;re implemented, posing challenges in maintaining stable practices.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Cozy Stack, a CNCF sandbox project launched in March 2025, presents a next-generation cloud platform built on Kubernetes. Unlike traditional platforms focusing solely on virtual machines, Cozy Stack emphasizes managed services with minimal dependencies, such as external storage systems. It functions as a framework for building custom platforms and offering managed services to customers.

Cozy Stack&#x27;s core strength lies in its commitment to bare metal infrastructure, which offers faster performance, lower costs, and enhanced sovereignty—ideal for AI, regulated, and edge workloads. Despite the complexity of rebuilding a cloud-like experience on bare metal, Cozy Stack simplifies this process by providing pre-baked images, storage networking virtualization, operators, cluster IP monitoring, and Kubernetes objects. Users can install Cozy Stack using an installer and access a dashboard to select desired services, which are essentially Kubernetes YAML objects with user-friendly configuration options.

The platform&#x27;s database service emphasizes the operator approach for managing complex tasks like database maintenance and ensuring correct logic execution. Users can create databases, manage user rights, configure backups, and set up monitoring dashboards using a single YAML file. Integrating third-party solutions is facilitated by Helm charts, which Cozy Stack extends through its aggregation IP server.

Cozy Stack&#x27;s tenant system mirrors Unix&#x27;s multi-tenant architecture, enabling specific Kubernetes namespaces for tenants while allowing centralized management of shared resources like Grafana or monitoring stacks. Users can authenticate via GitHub, GitLab, or Google and connect to their bare metal cloud using integrated key cloudexecute and OAuth servers.

For storage, Cozy Stack employs Linfield Store—a blend of proven technologies like LBM and ZFS—and enables rapid replication with DRBD protocol, minimizing virtualization overhead while maintaining efficient user workload utilization. In terms of networking, the platform leverages Selium for network policies and Cubefm for permissions, allowing live migration of VMs with existing IP addresses and VPC support.

In conclusion, Cozy Stack offers a powerful, customizable cloud infrastructure built on Kubernetes, focusing on managed services and bare metal technology to deliver fast, reliable, and cost-effective solutions. Users can join the community, engage in bi-weekly meetings, and contribute to the platform&#x27;s development on GitHub.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation, titled &quot;Project Lightning Talk: Container Builds At Scale With Buildpacks - Joe Kutner,&quot; introduces buildpacks as an innovative tool for managing container builds at scale, leveraged by companies like Salesforce, Google, Heroku, and Bloomberg. Buildpacks are CNCF incubating projects that translate source code into production-ready container images without Dockerfiles. They emphasize modularization, encapsulation, and composability, enabling the reuse of build logic across applications and languages.

Buildpacks offer advanced caching mechanisms and standardized container images, leading to more efficient resource utilization during builds and image storage. This results in reduced CPU and memory consumption, making container builds more sustainable – both in terms of performance and environmental impact.

The presentation highlights the &#x27;rebase&#x27; feature, which allows updating application base images via JSON manifest updates without rebuilding entire images, saving valuable resources. Users can start using buildpacks by installing `pack` CLI or employing existing builders provided by platforms like Heroku, Pquetto, and Google. A Kubernetes operator called KPAC is also available for containerization under Spring Boot, leveraging buildpacks internally.

To learn more about the project, the speakers invite attendees to a follow-up talk at noon on day two and encourage participation in the CNCF Slack channel&#x27;s buildpacks community.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">1. **Open Governance Accelerates Growth**: Initially hesitant about donating K Gateway to the CNCF, Solo.io soon noticed improved engagement and reduced concerns about license changes post-donation. The regret lies in not initiating this sooner.

2. **Focus on Core Features**: In an attempt to cater to various edge use cases, K Gateway initially supported numerous features like Kubernetes, Nomad, console support, file upload, and NAT. This led to performance degradation due to the complexity of implementing these abstractions, overwhelmed users with unclear functionality, and increased maintenance burden for the development team. The new strategy emphasizes focusing on the 80% of users by eliminating niche features, ensuring scalability and maintainability through in-process extendability and standard data plane interfaces like Envoy XR/Exo.

3. **Incomposability for Better Integration**: By building K Gateway as a composable component that could be integrated with service meshes like Istio, Solo.io initially envisioned seamless integration. However, this approach introduced friction as users didn&#x27;t require a full-fledged service mesh just for ingress management. The solution was to maintain independence and allow users to incorporate K Gateway as a waypoint, offering them more control over their infrastructure.

4. **Scalability Enhancements**: Starting from version 2, K Gateway scaled significantly better, with even greater performance improvements in version 2+ due to the Agent Gateway. The emphasis is on defining scale goals early, testing against these targets, and setting user expectations transparently regarding what can be achieved.

5. **Lessons Learned**: Over eight years, Solo.io learned valuable lessons about open governance, focusing on core features, incomposability for better integration, scalability enhancements, and the importance of communicating clear scale goals and expectations to users.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In the current project lightning talk on six storage within Kubernetes, three key advancements are highlighted by Xing Yang from VMwell by Broadcom:

1. Recover from resize failure: A significant issue with volume expansion was addressed by introducing a mechanism to recover from mistakes, like entering an incorrect size during expansion. Previously, this error would result in continuous retries without success due to the lack of shrinking support. This feature is now Generally Available (GA) in Kubernetes 1.34, enabling users to rectify their mistake by simply specifying a new PVC size that&#x27;s larger than the original volume.

2. Volume attributes class: Previously, storage classes defined parameters for dynamic provisioning during PVC creation but couldn&#x27;t be altered post-provisioning. To address this limitation, the team introduced volume attribute classes—mutable parameters set within these classes that can be changed after volume creation. Two example classes are silver and gold, allowing for adjustments in IOPS after volume provisioning. This feature is now GA.

3. CSI sidecar consolidation: The complexity of managing multiple CSI sidecars, each handling specific volume operations with varying Kubernetes releases, was identified as a concern. To tackle this, the team aims to unify all sidecars into a single mono-repository, targeting alpha status in Kubernetes 1.36. This initiative will streamline resource utilization and maintenance efforts by eliminating the need for individual sidecar updates with every Kubernetes release.

The talk concludes by inviting interested parties to engage with storage sessions and events at CubeCon and express interest if they find these advancements intriguing.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In this talk, Sonny Shi discusses the concept of invisible FinOps and compliance through a shift-left approach using Cloud Custodian. He emphasizes that every cloud resource creation incurs spending on time and money due to numerous configuration options. The goal is to avoid overspending by identifying optimization opportunities, shifting these actions to the left – before they become significant expenses.

Shi introduces policy as a declarative rule defining the desired cloud environment with automated enforcement for real-time visibility and instant action. Cloud Custodian policies can operate on live resources and infrastructure as code (IaC), flagging inconsistencies early, such as underutilized resources or unapproved instance types.

To implement this effectively, Shi recommends starting small with sensible limits in lower environments before scaling to production. Socializing these policies across the organization is crucial through clear communication. Developers should be enabled rather than hindered by these policies, which initially focus on basic, self-evident practices like using appropriate instance types for resources.

Finally, attendees are encouraged to explore Cloud Custodian on GitHub and join bi-weekly community meetings hosted at project pavilions during events like CubeCon.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Project Lightening, led by Technical Evangelist Flynn, discusses Linkerd, a service mesh focusing on enhancing application security, reliability, and observability without requiring changes to the application code. The process involves using lightweight Rust microproxies called microproxies to inject Mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communications within the mesh.

The presentation centers around two major issues related to mTLS certificate management:

1. Trust Anchors: For Linkerd to utilize a certificate, it must be rooted in a cert known as a trust anchor residing in a trust bundle. If this anchor expires or needs renewal, a new one is generated while rotating certificates in the mesh. This transition period allows for a smooth changeover from an old to a new trust anchor without disrupting service.

2. Incorrect Certificate Rotation: Incorrect documentation in previous Linkerd versions suggested a flawed rotation methodology, resulting in blue and red certificates remaining in the mesh while only having a renewed redert trust anchor. This scenario caused issues as Linkerd lacks control over organizational certificate management policies; it works alongside tools like Venivid Search Manager for such tasks.

Search Manager&#x27;s default behavior before version 1.18 was to update the validity dates of certificates without changing their private keys, which might seem like a new certificate but is fundamentally the same one with updated expiration dates. Linkerd acknowledged that this practice worked with older managers due to similar blue anchors, but after upgrading to Manager 1.18 (which changed default behavior to always issuing new keys), compatibility issues arose when users upgraded to the newer version.

The talk emphasizes collaboration within ecosystems and the importance of streamlining inter-project coordination for better user experiences. Flynn encourages feedback and suggestions for enhancing Linkerd&#x27;s capabilities, having gained valuable insights from this experience. Additionally, they introduced support for Mesh Control Plane (MCP) in Linkerd, inviting viewers to explore it by scanning a QR code and connecting with them via Slack or the project kiosk in the pavilion.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In this demonstration, Lin Sun introduces Istio&#x27;s Ambient mode, a service mesh setup that enables traffic management and security without traditional sidecar proxies. This feature is achieved by labeling the Kubernetes namespace with &#x27;istio-mode=ambient&#x27;, enrolling all pods within it into the Istio control plane. 

Ambient leverages Layer 7 capabilities for policy enforcement using HTTP routes to control traffic shifting between different service versions, such as RAG version one and two in this case. To demonstrate, Lin Sun sets up a demo application, RAG services (version one and two), and an ingress gateway. He then configures an HTTP route policy to direct traffic from the ingress gateway to the appropriate RAG version based on file types handled by each service.

In essence, Istio Ambient offers a lightweight, policy-driven approach for managing microservices without relying on sidecars or complex configuration. This setup automatically handles mutual TLS, layer 7 metrics, observability, and traffic control/authorization policies through the Waypoint component. With this simple labeling and configuration, services within an enrolled namespace can seamlessly communicate securely while benefitting from advanced service management features offered by Istio.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The Copaetic project, now in the CNCF sandbox, aims to directly patch container image vulnerabilities. It&#x27;s a CLI written in Go, utilizing Docker&#x27;s BuildKit for efficiency. By default, it uses Trivy for vulnerability scanning, identifying OS-level issues like outdated OpenSSL libraries. The tool creates a patch layer, a difference between the current and initial image, which is then appended to generate a new, patched image.

Copa supports multiple platforms and OCI media types, expanding its utility beyond Docker images. It can now identify and fix vulnerabilities within application dependencies like Python and Node.js. Additionally, Copa is developing features for bulk patching and integration with build tools such as BuildKit, Docker, and BuildKit front ends.

Interested individuals can explore the Copa project on GitHub via a QR code provided during the talk. Regular community meetings are held weekly on Wednesdays at 6:30 p.m. Eastern Time. A GitHub action facilitates using Copa within build workflows, while a Docker extension and plugin repo enable users to create custom scanner plugins for enhanced functionality.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In Cortex, a scalable Prometheus replacement project, data distribution is being reevaluated to enhance reliability and availability. The current system employs a remote write path with distributor and gesture microservices, utilizing tokens for distributing data across clusters of Ingesters. However, this token-based approach has limitations: if multiple Ingesters fail, it results in 100% cluster downtime due to the need for two out of three replicas for successful processing.

To address these issues, Cortex is introducing a partitioning strategy. Partitions replace token-based sharding, allowing Ingesters to join specific partitions with unique tokens assigned by the ring. With this approach, each time series is now associated with one partition, and data is routed to three randomly selected Ingesters within that partition. This not only improves data locality but also significantly enhances availability. If two Ingesters fail, only those processing the corresponding partitioned time series will be impacted – a 10% chance of downtime compared to 100% in the original system.

This partitioning strategy decreases failure domains and improves overall cluster resilience as the number of partitions increases. Cortex v1, which incorporates these improvements, is currently being released, with plans for further integration with Prometheus 3.0, support for remote write v2, and optimization through park spark format. The team encourages interaction via various channels and invites attendees to their kiosk at Pavillion tomorrow and Wednesday.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Project Lightning introduces ModelPack, an open standard for packaging, distributing, and running models within cloud-native environments. This vendor-neutral, open-source specification aims to simplify packaging AI code and weights into a format similar to container images. Users can leverage various tools to construct model artifacts from their Git repositories, which are then pushed into OCI compatible registries like Docker, Docker Hub, Harbor, or other cloud registries.

Once stored in the registry, users can pull down these model images using different tools and utilize them with Kubernetes, Hover, Cryo, or JumboFlag for distribution. The team has been actively integrating ModelPack with key ecosystem components such as Kubernetes, Hover, Cryo, and JumboFlag. The project is currently in a working progress phase.

The speakers will present ModelPack at the upcoming event, detailing its integration with Harbor – a container registry – for proper model storage. They&#x27;ll also discuss Django Flight, a peer-to-peer network or storage solution designed to efficiently distribute AI models within a cluster. Attendees can find more information about ModelPack on the project&#x27;s website, GitHub, and Snack platforms. The team provides a specification markdown for ModelPack details and a simple getting-started guide to help users navigate workflows. A QR code leads directly to the ModelPack&#x27;s GitHub repository and Snack presentation.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Crossplane v2 introduces significant improvements over its predecessor, offering a more streamlined, flexible, and powerful cloud-native control plane. Key enhancements include:

1. Simplified scope management: Crossplane v2 allows for composite resources that can be namespaced or cluster-scoped, providing developers with the freedom to decide at what level to expose their APIs. This addresses the complexity caused by the claim-to-XRD conversion in Crossplane v1.

2. Enhanced application support: V2 offers less opinionated stack capabilities, enabling users to compose any resource – managed or non-managed – into a single composite resource. This includes support for various operators and CRDs from cloud providers like CloudNativePostgreSQL.

3. Resource bloat reduction: Crosslane v2 combats excessive resources issue using manage resource activation policies, which allow for dynamic installation of only necessary CRDs from a provider, thereby reducing API server load.

4. Improved tooling and integration: Users can now generate Crossplane providers using Upjet for almost any Terraform provider, making it easier to create and integrate custom resources. Additionally, crossplane diff and observability features mirror those of the Terraform plan command, ensuring backward compatibility (with the exception of deprecated features).

5. Revamped documentation: The talk emphasizes a significant overhaul of Crossplane&#x27;s documentation, making it more accessible and user-friendly for newcomers.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Eitan Yarmush, an architect at solo.io and a maintainer of K agent and Agent Gateway, introduces K agent as part of a broader concept: rethinking the open-source agent stack. He defines an agent as comprising three elements: a system prompt, a language model (LM), and tools. The core loop involves Bob, the agent, sending messages, appending the system prompt to the LM, which then decides whether to invoke tools. If so, these tools execute actions like interacting with systems such as GitHub, Docker, Slack, or object storage via MCP (MCP acts as a USB for tool connections).

Yarmush envisions an agent as a seven-layer cake: the framework orchestrating agents and tools. Recognizing the declarative nature of agents, solo.io developed K agent to run these in Kubernetes using YAML definitions, making it easy to understand for Kubernetes ecosystem members. This project aims to simplify agent management while maintaining versatility and ease of use within Kubernetes. K agent is currently gaining traction, with some companies already running it in production, and solo.io eager to discuss its potential further at their booth.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In this Lightning Talk, Gabriele Bartolini introduces CloudNetPG, a project aimed at running PostgreSQL in Kubernetes environments &quot;the Kubernetes way.&quot; Historically, databases like PostgreSQL, stateful pets, have faced challenges with Kubernetes&#x27; generic resource management due to their unique requirements such as streaming replication, synchronous backups, and write-ahead logs.

CloudNetPG addresses these issues by providing an operator called Claronet PG, which utilizes a custom controller instead of the default stateful set. This tailored approach offers fine-grained control over PostgreSQL pods and PVCs, enabling declarative management of the database as a pet within the Kubernetes herd – the &quot;elephant herd&quot; metaphor for managing stateful applications in a Kubernetes environment.

Claronet PG leverages Kubernetes features like affinity taints and tolerations to logically group database pods alongside microservices, optimizing performance by placing them on high-performance bare metal nodes with local storage. This setup allows users to build the share-nothing architecture favored by database experts within the robust framework of Kubernetes.

The current version of CloudNetPG offers production-ready PostgreSQL HA, featuring automated failover, upgrades, declarative backups, and comprehensive observability. The team&#x27;s immediate roadmap includes advanced features like failover quorums for synchronous replication, 4end data management, first-class extension container images, and more.

Gabriele emphasizes the importance of community involvement, encouraging both end-users and contributors to join CloudNetPG – an openly governed, vendor-neutral project with over 15 initiatives. He invites attendees to contribute by adding their companies to the adopters list, which serves as evidence for CloudNetPG&#x27;s maturity and adoption, crucial for its upcoming CNCF incubation submission.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Gerald Combs, creator and lead developer of Wireshark and Falco maintainer, presents a collaborative threat detection system using Falco and Stratoshark. Falco, a cloud-native real-time threat detection engine, monitors system calls and sends alerts for suspicious activities, optionally saving system calls to capture files. Stratoshark, based on Wireshark, enables local investigation of system calls and log messages using captured data from Falco.

Combs demonstrates how Falco&#x27;s alert (a shell execution in a container) triggers Stratoshark, allowing users to examine system calls and enriched logs. By applying filters, analysts can trace bash commands, follow stream processes, and uncover malicious activities like attempting to install a backdoor SSH key via curl command piped into bash.

Stratoshark&#x27;s features facilitate pivoting and drilling down into events for further investigation, while Falco.org and StratShark.org offer resources for learning more about each tool. The talk underscores the importance of open-source communities in fostering such collaborative security solutions.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In this engaging lightning talk, Courtney Nickerson introduces Kyberno, a Kubernetes native policy engine, focusing on its new cell-based policy types—dubbed &quot;Kyverno Five.&quot; These policies are designed to enhance security and control within Kubernetes environments.

1. **Validating Policy**: Acts as the cluster&#x27;s voice, extending Kubernetes&#x27; admission validation with Kyverno specific features like spec evaluation. Cell expressions within validations enforce labels for stricter policy management.

2. **Mutating Policy**: Adds riffs by modifying requests using cell-driven patches, applying configuration objects or JSON patch arrays for declarative merges or surgical changes. It can inject sidecars and enforce resource limits, ensuring adherence to Kubernetes standards.

3. **Generating Policy**: Maintains the cluster&#x27;s rhythm by creating supporting resources, cloning objects across namespaces, building config maps, secrets, and network policies using generator apply functions. Synchronized mirrors are maintained with the source using &#x27;synchronize&#x27; true.

4. **Image Validating Policy**: Enforces software supply chain security by verifying image references against trusted registries. It requires that testations and signatures verified only from SIG store or cosign, ensuring secure usage of defined repositories.

5. **Deleting Policy**: Ensures cleanliness by removing stale resources selected based on match constraints. This proactive cleanup feature keeps deployments up-to-date and secure.

6. **Cell Libraries**: A recent addition, these libraries act as new instruments with predefined functions like querying Kubernetes resources, validating image metadata, or performing timely operations through cell expressions. The use of Cell libraries results in exponentially improved performance due to efficient communication between Kyverno and Kubernetes.

In summary, the Kyverno Five—validating, mutating, generating, supply chain security, deletion, and cell library policies—collaborate seamlessly with Kubernetes to provide robust, secure, and efficient policy management within your Kubernetes environments. Contributions are warmly invited in the project pavilion (kiosk 13b) for continuous improvement.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Open FGA, led by Octa and Graphana with contributions from various companies, is a centralized authorization system designed for developers. It operates on relationship-based access control principles, blending RO-based and attribute-based models, inspired by Google&#x27;s Zanzibar paper. This open-source project simplifies authorization in applications by providing an authorization model (organization and roles) and data (tupils), stored in a centralized data store like SQLite, PostgreSQL, or MySQL.

Open FGA enables developers to create complex hierarchies of permissions with ease, using the Go SDK or other popular language SDKs. It allows for cascading permissions—inheriting access rights from one object type to another (e.g., an organization&#x27;s admin can edit documents within their folders).

In this talk, Tyler Nix highlighted Open FGA&#x27;s recent graduation into the CNCF incubation program, joining a select group of security and compliance projects. The project aims to offer unique authorization capabilities, differentiating itself from counterparts like Open Policy Agent or Keycloak by its relationship-based model and focus on developer-friendliness. Attendests are encouraged to explore Open FGA further at the project pavilion during the event, with additional talks scheduled by Octa&#x27;s Jose and Alice on Thursday.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">OVN Kubernetes, a CNCF project, is a scalable, production-grade networking solution for Kubernetes clusters. It leverages OVS (Open Virtual Switch) and OVN (Open Virtual Network), abstracting complex networking constructs into logical network topologies that OVS then programs using open flows. The project supports core Kubernetes features like port routing, service networks, and network policies, along with advanced features such as egress controls, bandwidth management, hardware offload for wire speed networking, and multi-tenancy through userdefined networks. These networks can be advertised via BGP to import/export routes, ensuring isolated communication between namespaces within the Kubernetes cluster. OVN Kubernetes collaborates closely with CNI (Container Network Interface) for VM networking, enabling static IP assignments and persistent source IPs during reboots or migrations. For future enhancements, the project supports both overlay and non-overlay modes using Geneva encapsulation, BGP, and EVPN, allowing end users to extend their isolated networks into provider fabric environments. To engage with OVN Kubernetes, visitors can scan the QR code at kiosk 15A during CubeCon or join online discussions on CNCF Slack, community meetings, and the project&#x27;s website for more information on its roadmap and features.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Kubewarden, presented by Robert, is a universal policy engine for Kubernetes. Its purpose is to enforce specific rules and guidelines on the creation of configurations within a Kubernetes cluster. The engine aims to be versatile, supporting various policies from different sources like RIO Kyverno, the Policy Artifact Hub, or custom-made ones.

The project caters to three main user personas: consumers (end-users whose behavior is governed by policies), developers (creators of these policies), and operators (those who manage policy implementations). To accommodate diverse needs, Kubewarden supports multiple programming languages—from native binaries in C and Go to Rust.

Kubewarden adopts a gitops approach but takes it further by promoting the concept of &quot;policies everywhere.&quot; This means enforcing policies not just within the Kubernetes cluster but also outside it, such as in VMs or edge use cases, ensuring policy compliance universally where required. The team acknowledges that some operations might not naturally fit into Kubernetes yet recognizes the necessity for robust policy enforcement in those areas too.

The talk encourages viewers to engage with Kubewarden by scanning a QR code linked to its project page, inviting potential adopters, contributors, and maintainers to join the growing community. The speaker also invites interested individuals to visit the Couparden kiosk for demonstrations of upcoming tools like the new Sboomb scanner in alpha form.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">The presentation, led by Weizhou Lan, focuses on SpiderPool, a dynamic topology-aware RDMA allocation system for efficient GPU usage in multi-tenant AI inference clusters. The challenge lies in allocating GPU and RDMA device resources finely, considering PCIe affinity, across distributed inference tasks utilizing both tensor parallelism (with four GPUs per node) and data parallelism (spread across two nodes).

SpiderPool addresses two key issues: the separation of GPU and RDMA device allocation as distinct components, which doesn&#x27;t coordinate their allocation based on PCIe affinity; and the need for assigning dedicated RDMA devices with unique IP addresses to each port, enabling individual tracking of RDMA traffic within the network.

The project introduces Spot, a single plugin offering singular functionality that enables underlying networking for containers, specifically for RDMA network interfaces. In its latest version, Spot implements DIA (Direct I/O) and NI (Network Interface) capabilities, enhancing AI inference&#x27;s networking requirements. Spot detects PCIe affinity between N-GPUs and allocates fine-grained RDMA devices accordingly, ensuring better efficiency in resource utilization.

Two approaches are presented: prefind resource allocation and adaptive RDM resource allocation. Prefind resource allocation allows users to create a resource claim template specifying how interfaces should be assigned from master network interfaces, applying only the specified parameters during port creation without considering PCIe topology for GPUs. Adaptive RDM resource allocation, on the other hand, enables users not to specify detailed configurations at the NI phase of port startup. Instead, Spot detects the PCIe slot allocated by the GPU device plugin and assigns RDMA devices with PCIe affinity for those GPUs, an adaptive strategy that traditional GPU and RDM device plugins cannot match.

In conclusion, SpiderPool offers several novel features for AI inference, particularly in resource-constrained environments, enhancing efficiency through dynamic topology-aware RDMA allocation.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">OPA, or Open Policy Agent, a CNCF-graduated 10-year-old project, serves as a general-purpose policy engine that processes inputs through predefined rules and conditions to generate outputs. It&#x27;s particularly useful for authorization logic decoupling and checking conditions like container source trust in Kubernetes environments.

The team recently released OPA 1.0, which included significant performance enhancements achieved by optimizing work done without necessity, reducing allocations on hot paths, and improving the efficiency of the abased interpreter. They utilized sync.pool more extensively for reusing previously created applications, thus minimizing garbage collector thrashing.

Version 1.4 improved text handling built-ins&#x27; efficiency by making fewer allocations when needed, while version 1.3 enhanced decision log generation&#x27;s performance—a feature beneficial for audit logging. OPA&#x27;s compiler, storage layer, and rule indexer have also received improvements in subsequent releases.

The upgrade to the 1.0 language version is relatively straightforward, with tools available to streamline the process. OPA format is a valuable linter that helps users write better Rego code, and the team has exciting future plans, including new keywords, string interpolation, enhanced rule indexer features, type checking, and more.

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">Olen, Harvard community maintainer and CNCF ambassador, introduces Harbor, a container registry project under the Cloud Native Foundation (CNCF). He clarifies that while it may seem like just a container registry, Harbor offers more, especially in the realm of AI model management with NoCI capabilities. The project, initiated in 2014 at VMware and open-sourced in 2016, was donated to CNCF in 2018 and graduated in 2022, marking its 11 or 12th anniversary.

Olen highlights recent updates:
1. TLS support on the registry connection is now available as of version 214, a long-requested feature.
2. Enhanced language support and improvements in cloud-native AI model integration have been implemented.
3. The garbage collection process has been optimized.

For detailed information, attendees are invited to the maintainers track during Thursday&#x27;s noon session. ARM, through Ronnie, has approached Harbor for an ARM-compatible version, and a multi-architecture build implementation is currently under review, set to be included in version 215.

As a demonstration, Olen sets up a K3S cluster to run Harbor on ARM using Ronnie&#x27;s Docker Hub image. This quick showcase aims to assure the community that the ARM compatibility is not just a promise but a reality, thanks to contributions from Ronnie and the broader community.</div>

          <div class="mt-1 small" style="white-space: pre-line;">In the Kubernetes environment, traditional observability faces challenges with data protection, especially when handling sensitive information such as user identification, tokens, and internal metadata. In traditional systems, logs are collected, processed, and stored, often requiring decryption for analysis, which exposes the data to potential exposure risks. This issue arises during both data at rest and in transit phases since plaintext is necessary for processing and analysis.

Confidential computing addresses these concerns by providing hardware-based encryption using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) like Intel TDX or AMD SEV. These systems securely isolate the computational process, ensuring that sensitive data remains encrypted even when being used or processed. Confidential containers extend this concept to Kubernetes, placing a VM inside a confidential container, maintaining end-to-end encryption of data from application ports all the way to the observability pipeline and storage in Elasticsearch.

Key benefits of implementing confidential observability include:
1. Enhanced security for data in use (processing and analysis), complementing traditional protections for data at rest and in transit.
2. Preventing unauthorized access, as only authorized entities with proper credentials can decrypt and view the data within secure boundaries set by a key management service.
3. End-to-end encryption for observability pipelines, ensuring that logs and telemetry data remain protected both during transmission and processing stages.

This approach is particularly valuable for organizations dealing with sensitive information such as government entities, healthcare providers, financial institutions, and companies adhering to strict regulatory requirements where data privacy is paramount. Confidential observability helps fill the gap left by traditional methods in safeguarding data during its usage phase.</div>
